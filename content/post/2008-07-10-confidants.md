The Girls Confide @ the W San Diego

I suspect they have a bond that will affect them both for the rest of their lives &ndash; a bond beyond the normal mother/daughter ties. They&rsquo;ve been through so much together, and while each knows how to push the other&rsquo;s buttons, they ebb and flow together like kindred souls. As Jordan grows ever more mature, transforming into a graceful young woman, I enjoy watching her take quiet comfort in the company of her mother.
