Holy cow! Our friends have really stepped up to help on the project I mentioned last week. So many volunteers and such opportunities to make the day awesome for Jordan. Thank you to everyone.

My good friend Sallie Green suggested that I post our <a href="http://public.iwork.com/document/?a=p38254535&d=20110213_WarPaint_Overview.key" target="_blank" rel="noopener">project creative brief</a> to the blog so that she could forward the material on to some others who might want to participate.
