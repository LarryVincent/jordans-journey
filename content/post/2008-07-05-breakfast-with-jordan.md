Jordan recounts a story over eggs and fruit.

She&rsquo;s wired just like me. It&rsquo;s wonderful! This weekend we bunked in the same room. Jeanette and Jordan slept in one bed, I slept in the other&hellip;with the dog. I would wake up first, just as the sun was rising. I&rsquo;d smack my lips a bit, roll over and rub my eyes. As they came into focus, I&rsquo;d look over at the other bed. Jeanette would be crashed out, unwakeable. But no sooner than I looked over would I see my daughter rubbing her eyes and stirring in the bed. A few minutes later, the two of us would head out to breakfast. We&rsquo;re the early risers in the family. We take a kind of pride in it. And it makes for great breakfast conversations &ndash; just the two of us, feeding our faces and sharing our dreams.
