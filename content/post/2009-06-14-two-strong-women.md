Two Strong Women

One has quiet strength. She can withstand setback after setback, steel herself and trudge forward without much complaint. The other is a lion. She will overpower you with the force of her will, and let everyone in her path know that she has conquered you. My wife and my daughter flirt with strength on very different paths&ndash;paths that have converged on an epic scale. At times, they butt heads. But just as quickly, they console one another.  
In a few days, Jordan will be on summer break. The two girls will spend a lot of time together, some of it in a hospital, some of it on a bumpy road to recovery. It isn&rsquo;t clear yet how much work there is ahead, but one thing is certain: the women in my life will lead us through the next chapter of Jordan&rsquo;s Journey.
