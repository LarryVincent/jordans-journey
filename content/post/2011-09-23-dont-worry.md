I think I worried some of you because I&rsquo;ve been so quiet. Things are good. I&rsquo;ve been completely preoccupied in the final sprint to finish my book &hellip; and Jordan has continued her inspiring recovery. She goes to school nearly every day. She uses the walker and sometimes the wheelchair, but mostly she tries to do more and more with her legs, and they mostly cooperate. 

She came downstairs tonight to sit with me for a bit. I love our conversations. They&rsquo;re pretty random, but they&rsquo;re also punctuated with periods of silence, where we just sit together and enjoy each other&rsquo;s company. I look over at her and she smiles back. That makes me smile. A vicious, smiling circle ensues. Then we gab about something topical. 

It&rsquo;s good to have her home. It&rsquo;s good to have her being her.
