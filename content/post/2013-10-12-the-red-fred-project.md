Our friend Dallas Graham is launching the <a title="Red Fred Project" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2069622302/the-red-fred-project-50-books-by-50-critically-ill" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Fred Project</a> – A collaborative, story-making endeavor to publish 50 books created by 50 children with critical illnesses across the 50 states. It’s so inspiring. Jordan has been asked to be a contributor. The Kickstarter to fund the project closes this weekend. We rarely ask, but please help us spread the word and make this beautiful idea a big reality.
