Happy new year! Thank you to all who sent us well-wishes during the holiday season. I&rsquo;m sorry I haven&rsquo;t posted in awhile (or sent out any holiday cards). Between travel and the hustle that comes with the holidays I&rsquo;ve had little time to write.

![Jordan-Dec05][1]  
Jordan poses at a holiday tree lighting.

Jordan is doing well. She&rsquo;s looking healthier than she did a month ago. She isn&rsquo;t walking again, but her memory is improving, her eyes have stopped drooping and her color has returned. She&rsquo;s doing physical therapy twice a week. Everyone is focused on getting her back on her legs and out of the wheelchair.

The rest of the family is fine. There was really no time to rest during the holiday break, so Jeanette and I are giving thought to a weekend away &hellip; without the kids. It&rsquo;s just finding time to plan it that&rsquo;s proving problematic. I will write again soon.
