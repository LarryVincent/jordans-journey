QUICK UPDATE: We thought Jordan might come home today. Unfortunately, she still has a ways to go on her mobility. Her team doesn&rsquo;t think she would be safe back at home just yet. When I got the news this morning, Jordan was in a stairwell with physical therapists practicing climbs. She&rsquo;s motivated and working hard, but not ready to bid the hospital farewell. Tomorrow, she&rsquo;ll be evaluated and her doctors will decide whether or not she needs to spend more time at CHLA for in-patient physical therapy. Even though the slayer doesn&rsquo;t care much for this option, her mom and I are supportive. When Jordan lost the use of her legs five years ago because of a severe reaction to a chemotherapy drug, the intense regimen of in-patient physical therapy helped her ditch the wheelchair. I&rsquo;ll post soon, when I have more news. 

Thanks again to everyone who has followed along, sent words of encouragement, and kept us in your thoughts. It means a lot to Jordan and it means a lot to her family. You folks rock!
