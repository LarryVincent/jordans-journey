Her counts were good when she went for labs this week, so she&rsquo;s back on chemotherapy. She ran a slight fever Tuesday night. The medical team pulled her from school as a precaution and she has not returned.

She has a lot of trouble walking. She continues to lose her footing and fall often, but it&rsquo;s her stride that&rsquo;s most affected now. She walks awkwardly, with heavy steps. Her arms extend so that she can catch her balance and use furniture to steady herself. She doesn&rsquo;t move quickly and it takes all of her concentration to get from one point to another. She often asks us to carry her.

The medical team is considering prescribing a wheelchair for use at school. Everyone is concerned that she will hurt herself. When she&rsquo;s with her peers she overdoes it. The flip side is that a wheelchair could weaken her legs. Moving around keeps the muscles strong.

The family goes away to Palm Springs this weekend. Lucas has a swim meet and we plan to take some time to lounge by the pool. Jordan loves swimming and playing in the water. It should be therapeutic for all of us.
