The slayer is not well. I have little to say. She barely knew I was there when I stopped by to visit. She greeted me with an odd remark about a friend she has not seen in over a year. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s been saying that to everyone,&rdquo; Jeanetted confided.

While I stayed with her, Jordan sat in her bed with her arms at her side. She kept staring up at the corner of the room with a crooked smile on her face. Whenever we asked how she was she simply said, &ldquo;good.&rdquo; Nothing else.

She has been off Depakote for three days but her mental state seems to be getting worse. It makes me very sad. I miss my girl.
