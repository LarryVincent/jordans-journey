We talked to the orthopedic surgeon today. And, Jordan will need surgery. Two surgeries. They want to move tendons, sculpt muscle and chip bone&ndash;on each foot. It sounds dreadful. She wants to have the feet done at the same time, but the surgeon advised against it. He told her she would be in a cast for a month and not able to stand on her foot. She said that was okay. Jeanette made a deal with her. Try sitting for four hours. If she is fine just sitting, we can talk about doing both feet at the same time. Good God! I can hardly blame her. She wants one step in her journey to be expedient. But this one won&rsquo;t be.
