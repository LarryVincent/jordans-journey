This is a real snippet from our family dinner together on Saturday:  
Luc &ndash; Jordan, did you try the creme brulee?  
Jordan &ndash; Yes  
Luc &ndash; How did it taste?  
Jordan &ndash; Oh. Like falling in love.  
Luc &ndash; No, not a metaphor. How did it really taste?  
Jordan (casting her eyes to the ceiling and looking dreamy &ndash; a pregnant pause, and then&hellip;) Like a warm pine cone.

She&rsquo;s my little poet.
