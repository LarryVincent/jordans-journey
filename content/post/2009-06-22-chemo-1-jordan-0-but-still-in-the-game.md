She had a rough chemo day. She did great getting accessed and hob-nobbing with some visiting celebrities. But the drugs socked her a little harder than usual. We think her body is starting to tolerate them less. She gets sick almost as soon as they drip. Fortunately, she doesn&rsquo;t need to tolerate the drugs for much longer. Though chemo may have won today&rsquo;s battle, you&rsquo;d have a hard time seeing it now. When I came home, she was still glad to see me, still incessantly chatty, and still spirited in just about every way.
