One week after restarting chemo, her counts are fantastic. Her medical team was aptly impressed by how well she&rsquo;s doing. Her Irish liver is stepping up again. That said, her counts are still expected to drop next week.  
She looks and feels great, and for that we are very happy.  
The big news of the day was the scene Jordan made at CHLA wearing her new, signature t-shirt. It&rsquo;s one of several she received from family friend Ron Peterson, co-founder of <a href="http://bayvi.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BayVI</a> sports apparel. Every shirt is graced with her name in larger than life type, and the descriptor: the slayer. She absolutely loves them. She attracted quite a bit of attention and interest from staff and fellow patients alike.
