She hasn&rsquo;t gone for the test, yet. She&rsquo;s very alert and trying to speak a lot. It must be frustrating for her because she has to repeat herself so much. Even then, we still don&rsquo;t understand what she&rsquo;s trying to tell us. One phrase is loud and clear: she wants to go home. She gets very sad when we tell her it won&rsquo;t be today. But she weather&rsquo;s through.

I told her she was &ldquo;a tough old broad.&rdquo; She nodded her head strongly. Then said, &ldquo;yes!&rdquo;
