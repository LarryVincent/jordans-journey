Jordan leapt forward with great progress this week. Her dressing was removed today and the surgical area is healing perfectly. Her mood is good and she&rsquo;s regained much of her physical and cognitive abilities. She&rsquo;s scheduled to start chemotherapy next week. In the meantime, her doctors have given the &ldquo;all clear&rdquo; to return to school and normal activity.

It&rsquo;s been a very good week. A la David Letterman, following are the top 10 reasons we know Jordan is getting better.<a name="more"></a>

10/ She sings spontaneously with songs of her own design (yes, this is normal behavior)  
9/ She&rsquo;s back to mismatching her clothing into eccentric and spirited combinations (again, normal)  
8/ She makes a huge mess out of her room on a daily basis  
7/ She &ldquo;takes a little nip&rdquo; from the sugar stash when we&rsquo;re not looking  
6/ She wants to go back to school  
5/ With her parents, she is generous with the attitude  
4/ She chases the cats around the house and attempts to dress them  
3/ She doesn&rsquo;t want to take a bath  
2/ She requests tea every morning  
And the #1 reason we know she&rsquo;s getting better&hellip;

She&rsquo;s doing everything possible to annoy her brother!
