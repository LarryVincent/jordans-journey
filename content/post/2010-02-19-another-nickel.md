As we approached Children&rsquo;s Hospital this morning, Jordan sighed and said,

&ndash; Children&rsquo;s Hospital. Another day, another nickel.

She&rsquo;s in the O.R. now. It will be a few hours before we see her again. I&rsquo;m all nerves. Unlike me, Jordan was witty, spirited and determined to get this done. I&rsquo;m certain she was nervous, too. But it didn&rsquo;t stop her from chatting with the nurses about rotations in the O.B. ward. Or from cracking a littany of jokes.

I&rsquo;ve lost count of how often she takes my breath away. She was unbelievable this morning. The lead anesthesiologist asked me, &ldquo;is she always this happy and talkative?&rdquo; If only he knew.
