Modeling Clothes is Fun!

I think the news is finally setting in. My clue: she tells everyone that her cancer is gone. Friends. Family. Complete strangers. Sometimes I think she says it just to remind herself. The list of things she wants to do next is endless. She wants to write a book. She wants to take up tennis again. She wants to travel to Texas. She wants to eat more sushi. The list goes on. She told me today that this was the best Christmas she ever had. I didn&rsquo;t have anything to say. I just gave her a big hug and kissed her on the head. It&rsquo;s fun to celebrate this with her. I haven&rsquo;t felt this good in years.
