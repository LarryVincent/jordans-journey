Framed

She calls me at 2pm. I&rsquo;m walking across Wilshire Blvd on a quest for iced tea. Her voice is charming, inflected, slightly authoritative.  
&ndash; Daddy, my computer doesn&rsquo;t work.  
&ndash; What&rsquo;s wrong?  
&ndash; It won&rsquo;t let me go on the internet.  
&ndash; Is your airport connection working?  
(muffled tones as she asks her mother the same question)  
&ndash; Now it works, Dad.  
&ndash; I love you.  
&ndash; I love you, too. I can&rsquo;t talk now. I&rsquo;m looking at things on Pottery Barn.  
&ndash; Well, have fun.  
&ndash; Thank you, my precious Daddy.
