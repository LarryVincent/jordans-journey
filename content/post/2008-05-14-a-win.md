For the first time since Jordan began her journey more than five years ago, we have cause to celebrate. Her MRI scans today revealed noticeable reduction in the size of the tumors. Her doctor was elated. So were we. She will be sticking with this drug protocol for the near future, hoping for further improvements in her condition.

As if that were not enough to celebrate, the way Jordan handled herself today was phenomenal. She made no fuss about getting accessed. She cooperated with everyone.

As we left the hospital she called out to one of the nurses who knows her well, &ldquo;I really \*am\* kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt!&rdquo;
