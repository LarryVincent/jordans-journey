The Dynamic Duo Dines in Style

We&rsquo;re buddies. She likes how I make her laugh, and I like how she just hangs with me. We both like to travel and we enjoy sophomoric humor. Oh, and we both appreciate the finer things in life. My daughter is a clever companion and a trying child. Someday, I hope she does things in a certain way because of my influence. I know I will look at the world forever through a different lens because of her.
