She was just delighted to see him. She is very fond of Dr. Finlay. He was accompanied by doctors from Moscow who were visiting and intrigued by Jordan&rsquo;s case. She didn&rsquo;t mind. She&rsquo;s also fond of a larger audience.

One minor update &ndash; she is now able to take her oral chemotherapy pills on her own. This is a \*big\* deal for her. As you might know from <a href="https://www.jordanvincent.com/2004/11/30/apple-sauce-toxin-and-blue-sprinkles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">earlier posts</a>, for a long time we had to break the pills apart and mix them in with apple sauce. She hated the taste. But a few days ago she decided to try swallowing the pills whole. She was successful and now she actually gets excited when it&rsquo;s medicine time. Unfortunately, her infectious enthusiasm has also resulted in a bizarre catch phrase. When I got home last night, the first words out of her mouth were, &ldquo;Dad, I just love taking my pills.&rdquo; It just sounds wrong.
