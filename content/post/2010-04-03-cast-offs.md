Wednesday, the casts come off for good. She&rsquo;s ready. She walks everywhere, climbs stairs, hurls her legs around like they were loose clothing. I keep telling her that her feet are going to be stiff, and it will probably hurt to move around when her legs are fiberglass free, but she can&rsquo;t wait. She rolls her eyes and says, &ldquo;I know, Dad.&rdquo; On a walk home from lunch this afternoon I told her how proud I was of her &ndash; how she made everything look so easy. She said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s easy when you just do it. That&rsquo;s all there is, Dad. You just do it.&rdquo;
