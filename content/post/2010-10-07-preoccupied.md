I haven&rsquo;t posted for awhile because life has kept me busy. And unfortunately, this will be a brief entry. Jordan went in for her second round of chemotherapy last week. While she handled it with the same fighting spirit we&rsquo;ve all grown to love, her counts are down this week. In fact, she&rsquo;s neutropenic, which means we&rsquo;ll need to keep her out of school and limit exposure to the world around her for a bit until her immune system recovers. She heads back to CHLA on Monday for another round of blood tests. Her next MRI is scheduled for October 27th.

I promise to post more soon.
