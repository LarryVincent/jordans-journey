Ow! Jordan neglects to brush her hair. When it gets really bad, Jeanette steps in. The photograph demonstrates the result.

We started her book this weekend. We selected pictures that would tell the story. My head keeps going nuts trying to solve a problem that really doesn&rsquo;t exist. I keep thinking, how am I going to help Jordan write a book? She doesn&rsquo;t think that linearly. Then, she walks up and says to me, &ldquo;this is the story about a girl who got cancer. One day, she had really bad headaches&hellip;&rdquo;  
She&rsquo;s got more storytelling ability than I give her credit for.
