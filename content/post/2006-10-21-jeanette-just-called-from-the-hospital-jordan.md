Jeanette just called from the hospital. Jordan suffered another seizure around 9am this morning. It was the longest yet&ndash;lasting nearly 20 minutes. The doctors have put her on a stronger medication. Continuing the two steps forward theme, before the seizure started, Jordan spoke to her mother and told her she wanted to go home. She&rsquo;s resting now and will probably be out for a good part of the day.
