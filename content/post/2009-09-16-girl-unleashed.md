There were murmurs on the other end of the phone. Before I could finish saying hello, Jordan interrupted me.

&ndash; Daddy, I can stop chemo!

Her voice was charged with excitement. She rattled off a thousand words a minute without a breath. I don&rsquo;t even recall most of what she said. I just lingered on the opening salvo. Jordan is stopping chemo.

She was a nervous beast this morning, yelling at her mom, yelling at her brother, pouting, fidgeting, and storming around in a moody melange of emotion. We had every reason to believe the appointment would go well, but it didn&rsquo;t abate the anxiety we all felt, most of all Jordan. When the news finally came, she sounded like a different kid.

Of course, we&rsquo;re relieved and cautious. We have to temper our excitement. We&rsquo;re celebrating, but we&rsquo;re mindful that next month we could get the news that the tumor is active again. Like everything on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey, there is no definitive milestone, and no concrete state of being. We have learned to live one day at a time&ndash;celebrate the good ones, weather through the bad. Today is a great day. Tomorrow we start again.
