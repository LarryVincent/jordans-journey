She turned nine yesterday. She bolted into our bedroom first thing in the morning, legs leaping out in front of her.

&ndash; Do you know what today is? You have to guess.

I stirred. Jeanette didn&rsquo;t.

&ndash; Is it your birthday?

&ndash; Yes, it is!

She climbed onto the bed. Jeanette turned over, squinting from one eye.

&ndash; What time is it?

&ndash; 5:30

Jordan was persuaded to venture into the kitchen and fetch a bowl of cereal. The rest of her day went pretty much the same. She told everyone she met that it was her day. And at the end of the day we went to her favorite restaurant: El Cholo. When the drinks arrived we toasted her nine spectacular years, and wished that the coming year would be one of happiness and health.
