For the second time in a row, we made it through October with Jordan in good health. The cursed month appears to be behind us. She&rsquo;s not only healthy, she&rsquo;s vibrant. Halloween was a tour de force. Luc turned in for the night long before Jordan did.  
She met with her oncologist on Wednesday and received a glowing progress report. In December, she&rsquo;ll get another MRI to track the changes in tumor growth. The outward girl makes us all feel optimistic. She is witty, loving and full of energy. We celebrated another quiet October with a feast and drinks. As we toasted Jordan, she smiled, lowered her head, and said more quietly than usual, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what I do &ndash; I kick cancer&rsquo;s butt.&rdquo;
