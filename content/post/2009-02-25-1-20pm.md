It&rsquo;s been a frustrating day. As much as I love Children&rsquo;s Hospital, and I do love them, they are a case study in dysfunctional operations. If not for the unbelievable talent of the doctors and nurses, I&rsquo;d consider moving Jordan&rsquo;s case somewhere else. But the doctors and nurses are fantastic and I can&rsquo;t imagine trusting her care to anyone else.

I took the day off to be with Jordan, but the hospital implemented a new policy that only one parent can be with the patient at any given time in the radiology unit. So, Jordan is resting in recovery and I&rsquo;m stuck in the lobby. It would have been nice to know about the rule change (especially since the hospital calls the day before to go through the procedure), but as I said, operational excellence is not CHLA&rsquo;s strong suit.

It&rsquo;s a long day and we&rsquo;re all a bit edgy. We won&rsquo;t know how the scan went until later this afternoon. Jordan has a list of requests for her team. She wants permission to pierce her ears and she wants them to stop giving intravenous chemotherapy. I suspect they&rsquo;ll clear the former and deny the latter.
