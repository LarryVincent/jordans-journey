Sometimes it is hard to find anything to write about. Jordan&rsquo;s story is blended with crescendos and quiet passages. During the most turbulent times the words pour out of me in my mind&rsquo;s effort to vent, cope and adapt. But during the tranquil moments I struggle to express the emotions. They are no less profound, just harder to express. As I watch Jordan orchestrate her life I am most often silent, introspective and humbled.  
Tomorrow she begins chemotherapy again. It is a new protocol &ndash; actually a mixture of new and old drugs. She will need to go to the hospital less because half of the protocol uses oral meds. I thought she would be happy about this, but then I forgot that she hates pills. She heaved a heavy sigh, then threw her arms into the air. &ldquo;Well, I guess I&rsquo;ll have to start eating apple sauce again.&rdquo; It was a reference to her penchant for mixing bits of pills into the fruity snack.<a name="more"></a>  
Jordan has grown very spiritual. She prays. She thumbs through the bible. She likes going to church. She asks questions about god. It makes me very uncomfortable. I am neither religious nor spiritual. When I go to church it&rsquo;s usually because there&rsquo;s a good speaker. Our church is perhaps the most liberal in America (it nearly lost its tax exemption in the 2004 election), and it attracts wonderful thinkers and activists. That&rsquo;s the draw for me. But for Jordan, the attraction is rooted in beliefs. She believes that god listens to her, thinks about her, heals her.  
It makes me uncomfortable because I don&rsquo;t know what to say when she talks of these things. I would never challenge her beliefs. They give her hope. She has faith, a wonderful, healing quality. On the other hand, I am leery that her spirituality will alter her tremendous self reliance. She has a beautiful independent will. I&rsquo;ve seen it in action. She has overcome the most trying physical challenges by willing the goals into realities. My remarkable daughter is a cancer survivor five years in the making because of her tremendous sense of self. She believes she can do anything, and she has. I am unapologetically stingy with the Lord. In my head, He had nothing to do with her success. But in Jordan&rsquo;s head, He guided her here. The whole conversation makes me squirmy.  
Yet, Jordan&rsquo;s spirituality is another sign of her growing maturity. As childlike as she often is, a strong woman is growing inside. She is wont to engage in profound meditation. She relishes the opportunity to behave with sophistication, grace and elegance. Whether it&rsquo;s correcting her family when they refer to the lady&rsquo;s room as the &lsquo;bathroom&rsquo; or preparing herself for another day, she embraces life with the refinement of a young lady. She&rsquo;s a trail blazer, make no doubt. But she&rsquo;s more complex than the maverick persona she sometimes entertains. What a pool of thought must circle in her head! She certainly inspires many in mine. And though they don&rsquo;t always spring to life in printed words, they quiet me when I&rsquo;m lost in triviality and burdened by occupation.
