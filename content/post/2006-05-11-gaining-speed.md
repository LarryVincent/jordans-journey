Jordan is doing so very well. The wheelchair is collecting dust. When she wears her splints, she can walk across the room without her walker, much to the consternation of her therapists. But most noticeable of all, she looks healthy. She is flush with color and her eyes sparkle. She&rsquo;s regained some weight (but her legs are still quite thin) and she talks all the time. Actually, she chatters like a magpie. The child always has something to say &hellip; and it&rsquo;s beautiful.
