This is a fantastic article on the strange way that pets and humans have a healing relationship. I believe it because Jordan has enjoyed pet therapy on a number of occasions, and I&rsquo;ve seen her do miraculous things when pets are present. For instance, she was in a coma, and yet when the therapy dog paid a visit she bolted upright in her bed. See the photos for proof.
