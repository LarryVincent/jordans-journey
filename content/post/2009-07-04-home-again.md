She is back from camp and in rare form. Jeanette said Jordan chatted incessantly on the drive home from the bus drop off. She really enjoys camp. She rode horses, swam, performed in the talent show and received a standing ovation for her rendition of _Baby Mine_. Apparently, she stopped herself midway through the song and said, &ldquo;wait, rewind,&rdquo; then started from the beginning.

I haven&rsquo;t seen the photos yet, but she said she took many photos. Yesterday, as we drove around Santa Monica as a family, she entertained us with some witty one-liners. She&rsquo;s very excited about the prospect of living near the beach.
