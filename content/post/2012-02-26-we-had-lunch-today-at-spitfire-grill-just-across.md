  We had lunch today at Spitfire Grill just across from the Santa Monica Airport. While Jeanette and Luc finished their meals, Jordan and I took a walk over to the field. We watched planes take-off and land. Jordan got so excited. It didn&rsquo;t matter that the wind was gusty and tinged with a little briskness. She stood up and leaned over the rail to get a closer look. Even though she said she wasn&rsquo;t cold, I threw my jacket over her to keep her warm.

  Awhile later, Jeanette and Luc joined us and Jeanette snapped this picture. It was a fun afternoon.
