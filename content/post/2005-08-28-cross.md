Jordan is doing well. She gets dizzy frequently, and whines constantly. We&rsquo;ve decided time was up to feel sorry for herself, so we gently admonish her when she starts moping.

I am cross today. I&rsquo;m not alone. The whole house is in a foul mood. We snap at one another over the most trivial matters. Patience is lacking.
