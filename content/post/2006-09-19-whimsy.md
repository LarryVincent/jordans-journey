You know you love the girl when you can close your eyes and picture her, riding belted in the car with a brimming grin and a chatty verse. You know you&rsquo;re smitten when you can imagine her vivid blue eyes smiling in a landscape of noise and all you can do is sigh. When the sound of her giggle moves you to lower your head and grin, you&rsquo;re hexed.<a name="more"></a>

Her eyes gush with life. And I don&rsquo;t care to think of them in the past tense. Yet sometimes it crosses my mind. Sometimes I feel blessed to have her here with me now. I&rsquo;m not supposed to think these thoughts. Of course she&rsquo;ll outlive me. Of course, she&rsquo;ll be the healthiest in the clan. It&rsquo;s all probably true. Still, she takes me. I can imagine her. I appreciate what she radiates. I revel in the soft touch of her hand and the sass in her voice.

I have this indulgent habit of making CDs for my girls. I&rsquo;ll spend hours hand-picking songs to burn onto a disc that they enjoy on their weekly trips to and from Children&rsquo;s Hospital for chemotherapy and physical therapy. Inevitably, I&rsquo;ll stumble across a song that hits a little too close to home. Tonight it was Patrick & Eugene&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Birds and the Bees."¬ù You may not know it by name, but you&rsquo;ve probably heard it in the new Volkswagen Rabbit commercial. I thought it would be a whimsical end to my latest spin masterpiece. And it is, except when I played it back, I started crying. The emotion poured over me like the first sip of a good wine. It was pleasant, and intoxicating. I pictured my girls riding around in Nettie&rsquo;s Jeep Liberty, both of them smiling. I pictured Jordan in the back seat singing along, only getting every few couple of words &ndash; a habit that annoys her brother. And I could not control the sobs.

I love this child. She is filled with a charm that overwhelms my senses. She is stylish and sincere, innocent and wily, spirited and fragile. I cherish growing with her and imagining her in many life situations. I dream of her as a teenager, mother, and grandmother. I am filled with anxiety that my dreams are vaporous &ndash; that every memory and observation is precious and must be perfectly archived so that one day I can tell others about her. I hate that feeling. It&rsquo;s the lingering scent of reality that every so often invades the vision of the girl; the muse. It&rsquo;s the theory of predestination applied to our family life &ndash; a sense of meaning and purpose rendered empty by the threat of absence.

I never know what to do with this feeling, so I tuck it away, until it will not recess.
