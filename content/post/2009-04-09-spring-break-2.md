Jordan enjoyed Spring Break this week. Frankly, I think she had too much time on her hands, but it didn&rsquo;t stop her from lamenting about Spring Break coming to an end. But she was particularly sweet on Tuesday &ndash; my birthday. She took my picture to put on a card for Sprout Online. They have a contest for birthdays. I posed patiently.

&ndash; Dad, smile more. Look excited.  
I widened my grin and tried to look excited. She snapped the photo.  
&ndash; Not that excited.  
She giggled and took another photo.  
&ndash; This one&rsquo;s perfect. Now, close your eyes.  
&ndash; Close my eyes?  
&ndash; It&rsquo;s just for fun, Dad.  
I complied.  
&ndash; No. Dad, how do I delete the bad ones?  
When my photo shoot was done, she made me a beautiful card, with an ornately hand-colored border and a fanciful illustration in the center. I helped her print the photo and construct the final product, then I thanked her for thinking of me. She gave me a giant hug and told me to be happy about being 14. I reminded her that I was actually turning 40. She said that was good, too. Then she skipped off.  
She returns to school next week, after chemo on Monday.
