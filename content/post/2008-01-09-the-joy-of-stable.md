The results from the MRI are in, and Jordan&rsquo;s condition is stable. It&rsquo;s not a very attractive word: stable. No real sex appeal. But, in her case, it&rsquo;s very good news. It means the drugs are working. When you combine the diagnosis with her buoyant personality and active behavior, stable is actually a very soothing word.

She was quite pleased with the news &ndash; even left me a bubbly message to say so.
