Jordan recommenced chemotherapy yesterday. We&rsquo;re scheduled for two more rounds of Cytoxan, then another scan near the holidays to see if we&rsquo;re making progress. Jordan handled the dose yesterday like a pro.

After seven years, I still found myself swept away by little moments with big impact. Yesterday, before they disconnected Jordan from all the tubes, she said, &ldquo;I think I might have a headache tomorrow, Mom. Maybe I can&rsquo;t go to school.&rdquo;

We push Jordan a lot, but we&rsquo;re generally willing to let her take a day off from school the day after chemotherapy. Jeanette didn&rsquo;t react to Jordan&rsquo;s prediction that she would be feeling poorly the next day.

This morning, when Jeanette went in to wake Jordan she predictably said she didn&rsquo;t feel well. Jeanette let her rest for a bit before broaching the question again.

&ndash; How do you feel? Do you think you might be able to go to school?

&ndash; My tummy hurts, mom.

&ndash; OK. Do you want to rest for a bit more? Remember, it&rsquo;s a short day. (She had a doctor&rsquo;s appointment in the afternoon)

Jordan rolled over and rested for another 20 minutes. Then she appeared in our bedroom doorway &ndash; dressed for school.

&ndash; Mom, can we stop at Starbucks on the way to school?

When Jeanette sent me a text message telling me that Jordan went to school today, I had to stop what I was doing and just admire my daughter. I can&rsquo;t explain how proud I am of her in moments like these. Such strength. Such determination. Such pride. I sent Jeanette a reply.

&ndash; Wow! She&rsquo;s going to school. She&rsquo;s my hero.

A minute later Jeanette replied.

&ndash; She says, &ldquo;thank you, dad. That makes me feel so good inside.&rdquo;

That makes two of us, kiddo.
