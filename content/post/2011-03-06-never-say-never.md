OK. So, we clearly had technical difficulties on the last post. I will reformat and post for those who wanted to see Jordan&rsquo;s photo narrative and my mini-documentary of her making it.

I also have much to write about &hellip; but not today. I&rsquo;m racing toward deadline on my next book and I&rsquo;m kind of out of words.

But! I will share this little tidbit. Jordan, Jeanette and I went last night to see Never Say Never, the Justin Bieber biopic. (Luc elected to sit this one out.) Jordan loved the film, and it wasn&rsquo;t just a mild crush on the Bieb. She loved every bit about the movie &ndash; his energy, the thought of rising from obscurity to social media phenom, the drive to do something when other people say, &ldquo;no way.&rdquo; At the end of the movie, when the Bieb starts singing the title track, Jordan turned to me and said, &ldquo;Just like me. Never give up.&rdquo;
