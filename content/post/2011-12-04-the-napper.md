Nothing intoxicates me more than she—she with the curly locks  
and the wicked grin  
and the sassy comebacks.

Nothing makes me more giddy than the flip of her fingers  
dismissing air and poor logic with irreverence  
and a hint of pregnant contempt.

Nothing endears me more than the intensity of her gaze—  
the eyes that will not settle for less than truth;  
the impatient pools of thought that are filled with abundant interest.

Nothing settles my soul more than the warmth of her hand  
trusting mine to guide her and escort her and comfort her  
even when it rests in a blissful sleep, just pressing close to mine.

Nothing comes close to this. Nothing.
