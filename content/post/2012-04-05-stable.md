We got the results from the Slayer&rsquo;s MRI yesterday. Overall, looks stable. One area might have some growth, but hard to say because it&rsquo;s small. She&rsquo;ll be back on chemo when her counts are stronger. She&rsquo;s still a little low. She&rsquo;s also coming back to CHLA for a few days so the neurology team can observe her in an effort to solve the issues with seizures and spasms. 

Jordan was upbeat. When she called me she said, &ldquo;I just really want some sushi.&rdquo;
