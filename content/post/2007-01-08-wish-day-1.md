![Jordan Limo Ride][1]

We&rsquo;re off! Jordan could not be more excited. Our day began when a stretch limo arrived at our house at 7:15am. Jeanette and I were still scurrying about packing the bags while the kids were climbing into the big sedan, lounging in style.

Our travels have never been easier. Both flights left on time and arrived early. And the folks at Make-A-Wish went out of their way to make it easy for us to get from point A to point B.

We dined at &lsquo;Ohana at the Polynesian Resort. Jordan danced the hula, paraded with the limbo line and got so excited about seeing Cinderella&rsquo;s castle that she skipped dessert (she wanted to see more). When we arrived at Universal&rsquo;s Portofino Bay Hotel, we were all rightly tuckered. We were delighted by our &ldquo;kids suite&rdquo;, with a colorful room for the kids and a plush bed for mom and dad. Jordan grabbed my hand and said, &ldquo;I love our new home.&rdquo;

More to come tomorrow. We&rsquo;re exhausted tonight.
