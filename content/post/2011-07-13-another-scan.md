Jordan is back at CHLA today for her quarterly MRI scans. As I write this, she&rsquo;s enjoying a great nap thanks to her usual propofol cocktail. She&rsquo;s had some rough times over the past few weeks. While there&rsquo;s no evidence of new tumor activity, the many tumors of the past have wreaked havoc on her system. She has seizures almost every day. They rarely last for more than a few minutes, but the larger ones sap her energy and make her want to nap. Sometimes her body just doesn&rsquo;t seem very cooperative. A leg will shake uncontrollably, or she&rsquo;ll get the shivers in 80 degree heat, or she&rsquo;ll completely lose her balance. It&rsquo;s beginning to tax her confidence, and that&rsquo;s hard to watch for us all. But she plows ahead like always.

We&rsquo;ll post more when we have new news.
