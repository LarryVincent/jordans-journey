I would call it a passive summer. There were no major milestones; no setbacks. It was as if we put our lives in neutral, reclined the seat, and napped for awhile with our hats over our eyes all-the-while keeping the engine running, just in case. My superstitious side grows restless when we enjoy a spell like this. I wonder if it is the universe&#8217;s way of preparing us for the next mile. But then I counsel my fears to stop being silly and relish the fact that The Slayer is well and she and I have enjoyed/endured a season of terrific normality.<!--more-->

Yesterday, while we were out for dinner, I watched her walk back from the ladies room. Every step was deliberate, her spindly legs elongating like a praying mantis then resting briefly to catch balance. She doesn&#8217;t have much of the latter, so she supported herself by bracing her hands against a passing booth and sometimes a table. The guests were often startled until they looked up and saw the smiling pixie making her way back to her table.

That&#8217;s how Jordan weathers through the challenges: unapologetically and with a smile. Her eyes reveal true grit, but her mouth wears a smirk that matches her life motto: never give up.

&#8220;That&#8217;s just how life is,&#8221; she tells me. &#8220;You can&#8217;t control it. You have to go with the flow.&#8221;

Others taught her these slogans and affirmations, but she has made them her own. She believes each and every one, and lives accordingly. It&#8217;s how she propels herself through all the setbacks and challenges and sudden turns we didn&#8217;t see coming. Jordan understands that life is more a mental game than it is a physical one.

In August we started reading together again. I&#8217;m ashamed to say I let this habit lapse. Jordan can&#8217;t read on her own, but she loves to be read to. My friend Kassie gave me and Jordan a copy of _Walk Two Moons_, by Sharon Creech. Every night before bed I come up to Jordan&#8217;s room, plop down in her stylishly pink beanbag chair, and read a couple of chapters. We&#8217;re nearly finished.

While we read, Jordan sits up in her bed, propped by a couple of overstuffed pillows. She multitasks, using a tray to color or work on some craft. Every so often, when something interesting happens in the story, she&#8217;ll pause and look over at me, her eyes deep-set into the world we&#8217;re exploring together. Then she goes back to her handiwork.

She listens intently. Sometimes, I quiz her &#8230; just to be sure she&#8217;s paying attention. Her comprehension and recall are amazing.

I forgot how much Jordan loves words. Inspired by her interest, I started reading her a sonnet every night, after the story. I tell her, &#8220;don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t understand the words. Just listen to them. Enjoy them.&#8221; After the fourth or fifth night of counseling her this way she moaned, &#8220;I know, I know, Dad. I get it.&#8221;

Last night I read her sonnet #17.

> Who will believe my verse in time to come,  
> If it were fill&#8217;d with your most high deserts?

After I tucked her in, I thought about these words. If I were to come upon this blog many years from now, I&#8217;m not sure I would believe all that I have written about The Slayer. She&#8217;s a remarkable young woman. I am lucky to enjoy this life with her; lucky to be her father. On this journey of more than a decade, I have been drawn to some very dark corners. But a little quality time with Jordan leads me back to a sound path. Though she says she knows it, I don&#8217;t think she understands how much of an impact she can have on those around her. She radiates.

This morning during the latter part of my SoulCycle ride, I closed my eyes in the darkened room and let my thoughts drift. In my stream of consciousness, I enjoyed a vision of my girl. She was running&#8211;not angling her limbs like an awkward spider wearing ankle weights, but full-on running. If it were a movie, my camera view was slightly behind her, tracking with her. Every so often she would glance back at me over her shoulder, her cheeks a delightful pink, her mouth a toothy smile. She runs so fast in this vision that I struggle to keep up with her&#8230;

I know it sounds mystical, but these occasional projections give me hope. They inspire me. That&#8217;s why there was a big smile on my face as I turned up the resistance and pushed just a wee bit harder in my workout.

While it is very unlikely that I will ever see that day when Jordan flat-out sprints across an open field, I can always help her find the rush that should accompany life—I can commit to pushing her in other ways, and letting her spirit run free. That&#8217;s what it&#8217;s like when we read, when we do photography projects, when we go out exploring museums and concerts and plotting new adventures.

It was a passive summer. And we are rested. It&#8217;s now time to challenge life again.
