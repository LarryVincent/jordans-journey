_A pantoum_

Love has never dwelled so hard in my heart.  
She softens my soul when she is near  
And empties it in absence  
Such that I have never loved nor feared its loss before.

When she is near she softens my soul.  
I am not the me that I think I am.  
I have so never loved nor feared I’d lose so much before  
Because her smile enriches my eager heart.

I am not the me I think that I am.  
My life is ever changed because of her.  
My heart is rich because of her eager smile  
That carries me and makes me strong enough to weep.

Because of her, my life is ever changed.  
It is empty in her absence.  
I weep enough to have the strength to carry on.  
I will not harden my heart so that my love may ever dwell.
