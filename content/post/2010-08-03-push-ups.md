I start &ldquo;Why Don&rsquo;t You Do Right&rdquo; on the stereo. Upstairs I hear her voice singing along. A few minutes later she thumps down the stairs.

&ndash;Get out of here, give me some money, too.

She sings along, missing several words but trying to carry the tune. Just as she&rsquo;s getting it, she interrupts herself.

&ndash;Dad, is this Peggy Holiday?  
&ndash;Peggy Lee.  
&ndash;She really is a good singer.  
&ndash;I&rsquo;m a fan.  
&ndash;Yeah, now I&rsquo;m going to do some push-ups.

She walks over to a corner of the room and begins doing push-ups. Push-ups! It&rsquo;s 10pm.

&ndash;Jordan, why are you doing push-ups?  
&ndash;I just feel like doing them.  
&ndash;Okay.

She finishes her routine about the same time that the music changes. Now, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;All That Jazz&rdquo; from the Chicago soundtrack (yes, I was immersed in jazz and showtunes). She doesn&rsquo;t know this one, but that doesn&rsquo;t stop her from honky-tonking around the room until something in her switches.

&ndash;This is how we do tree pose.

And, she&rsquo;s doing yoga&ndash;showing me how. She tries to hold her balance on one foot. It is not successful, but she wobbles a few times to get it right. She turns to me and smiles broadly and I smile back. I love her.
