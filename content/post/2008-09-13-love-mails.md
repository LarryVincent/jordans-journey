  Ever since Luc received a cell phone on his 10th birthday, Jordan has pestered us for a phone of her own. She reminded us nearly every day in the months leading up to her birthday in August. When it arrived, we didn&rsquo;t have to think very hard about what to get her. She says her phone is one of the best gifts she&rsquo;s ever received. She connects with her friends and family every day.

&ndash; Jordan, who are you talking to?  
&ndash; Grandma.  
&ndash; It&rsquo;s 6:30 in the morning!  
&ndash; That&rsquo;s ok, Dad. She&rsquo;s an early bird like us.  
&ndash; Jordan, that&rsquo;s too early to call people.  
&ndash; Dad, I&rsquo;m on the phone.  
This is how it goes now. But there are plentiful benefits. Nearly every day she calls me at work. I don&rsquo;t carry my phone around with me much, so I return to my desk to find new voice mails from her. They are breathy, and affectionate, and absolutely sincere. She practices her own phone protocol, which usually includes a moment of song. She called me yesterday and sang a few bars from _Hernando&rsquo;s Hideaway_. In the background, I could hear Luc admonishing her.  
&ndash; Jordan, that&rsquo;s too long of a message.  
&ndash; (in song) I know &hellip; a dark &hellip; secluded place &hellip;  
&ndash; JORDAN!  
&ndash; (still in key) a place &hellip; where no &hellip; one knows your face  
My voice mail box is reaching capacity because I refuse to delete these little love mails. She sprinkles each with poignant observations and heartfelt salutations. Her optimism and charm gush through, and even my worst day feels bright when I listen to these. Many of our friends and family have received their own doses. Which makes me think that perhaps this really is the best gift I&rsquo;ve ever given.
