Perhaps going under the knife for two brain surgeries did it. I imagine that would make most anything seem pretty tame to me. Or perhaps it&rsquo;s a side effect of the chemotherapy. Or maybe it&rsquo;s just the girl she&rsquo;s become. Jordan loves a good adrenaline rush.

That&rsquo;s right. She&rsquo;s a thrill-seeker. We know this because Thursday she tagged along with her brother and our friends James and Michael Muro to Universal Studios. She&rsquo;s tall enough to ride everything now, and ride she did &hellip; even when her brother chickened out. As you can imagine, she goads him about this constantly.

![Jordan at Universal Studios][1] 

Jurassic Park, The Mummy, Back to the Future &hellip; she rode them all. And she loved them. She can&rsquo;t stop talking about how fun they were. She&rsquo;s very proud that she didn&rsquo;t get scared. Quite the opposite, actually. She wants to go back and ride them again. Jeanette said the automatic ride photo from Jurassic Park perfectly captured Jordan&rsquo;s approach. As their boat tipped down to plummet four stories into a splash of water, everyone in the boat reeled back, wincing about what was to come. But not Jordan. She leans forward with a brilliant, toothy smile on her face.

Enter Jordan the adventurer. She&rsquo;s my young Mame. She lives the phrase, &ldquo;life&rsquo;s a banquet and most poor suckers are starving.&rdquo;
