Making a bouquet

We haven&rsquo;t taken a trip together for awhile &ndash; just Jordan and I. This weekend would remedy that. We flew to San Francisco for a long weekend of sight seeing, shopping and fine dining. Jordan had a great time, and so did I. We posted some <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/larryvincent/sets/72157606243965856/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cool photos from our trip on Flickr</a>.

Among the cool parts:

</p> 

  * Jordan telling me she wants to help me write Juliette (this should be fun)


  * Numerous self-disclosures to innocent strangers &ndash; &ldquo;I have cancer&rdquo;


  * Fish feast all around &ndash; we ate so much seafood I think we&rsquo;ve sprouted gills


  * She&rsquo;s become a shutter bug
</ul> 

<cite>And I just realized that she wore the same darn hoodie to San Diego. She really <em>does</em> have more than one set of clothes.</cite>
