Some keep the Sabbath going to church;  
I keep it staying at home,  
With a bobolink for a chorister,  
And an orchard for a dome.

Some keep the Sabbath in surplice;  
I just wear my wings,  
And instead of tolling the bell for church,  
Our little sexton sings.

God preaches, — a noted clergyman, —  
And the sermon is never long;  
So instead of getting to heaven at last,  
I’m going all along!  
&ndash; Song of Service by Emily Dickinson
