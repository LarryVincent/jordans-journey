Scientists at Stanford University used an EEG from a patient experiencing a convulsive seizure (like the ones that affect Jordan) to construct an audio recording using tones that fell into the human voice spectrum. The resulting audio track is haunting and reveals a fascinating perspective on what’s happening when the brain is disrupted by the electrical storm we call seizures.

To understand what you’re listening to, here’s an except from the piece in _Fast Company_:

> “Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=20s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">0:20</a>, the patient’s seizure starts in the right hemisphere, and the patient is talking and acting normally. Around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=1m50s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1:50</a>, the left hemisphere starts seizing while the right is in a postictal state. The patient is mute and confused. At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n0T2uB-GLc8#t=2m20s" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2:20</a> both hemispheres are in the postictal state. Patient is looking around, still confused, trying to pick at things, and get out of bed.”
