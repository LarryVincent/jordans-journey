Midway through the day, Jordan called me from Children&rsquo;s Hospital, where she was having her weekly blood work.

&ndash; Dad, I got two shots and I didn&rsquo;t cry!

&ndash; Two, shots! Why did you get two shots?

&ndash; Oh, I had to get a flu shot and a shot to help my body make more white blood cells.

There wasn&rsquo;t the slightest bit of concern in her voice, only pride at her accomplishment. I hadn&rsquo;t seen the two text messages Jeanette had sent me; the first to tell me Jordan&rsquo;s counts were very low and the second to tell me she was getting a dose of GCSF to boost white cell production from her bone marrow. I didn&rsquo;t need those texts. I had already pieced it together in my head and my heart kind of sank. Nevertheless, Jordan brought me right back up.

&ndash; Hey, Dad. Will you do a favor for me?

&ndash; Sure. What?

&ndash; Can you go into my Facebook and tell people that I got two shots and I didn&rsquo;t cry? Because I want to be healthy for Thanksgiving.

I was only too happy to oblige. I&rsquo;ll get the full download tonight. This is the expected consequence of Jordan&rsquo;s chemotherapy protocol. We expect it, but it&rsquo;s never very comforting. We now go back to becoming germ-phobic. Jordan&rsquo;s ANC is below 500, and her white blood cell count is dipping but her pride is over-abundant.
