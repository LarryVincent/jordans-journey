Family Affair

A flower behind the ear,  
colors draping from her frame,  
she leans forward when she walks.  
One hand stretches out,  
with fingers up-curled in dainty silhouettes,  
the other hand clenches into a defiant fist.

Damn the fates and mind my dress.

Grace and grit in one miraculous gait,  
She&rsquo;s one of a kind, and seldom kind to adversity.
