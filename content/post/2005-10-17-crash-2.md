Her counts hit the danger zone, as expected. Hemoglobin and white cells are down &ndash; so far down that she had to skip chemo this week and she&rsquo;s not allowed to return to school until her immune system recovers. She has to wear a mask when she leaves the house. Wednesday, she goes back to CHLA for a blood transfusion (my blood was still at the lab today), which will hopefully give her system a boost and restore her energy.<a name="more"></a>

The news hit me harder than I expected. When I checked voicemail and heard it from Jeanette my stomach sank. I suppose it is because, once again, I&rsquo;m on the road 2,000 miles away and Jordan&rsquo;s health has hit another speed bump.

On the flight, I sat next to a nurse on her way to help Katrina victims in Louisiana. I rarely talk to my seat-mate, but this woman was disarmingly friendly. As I talked to her about Jordan, I found myself trying to be upbeat. When I finished sputtering on about how tough my daughter is and how well we&rsquo;re handling it all, I looked over across the seat. The woman&rsquo;s facial expression told me she didn&rsquo;t buy it. She smiled knowlngly. Then she told me to pray because miracles \_\_can\_\_ happen. She said she sees them every day.
