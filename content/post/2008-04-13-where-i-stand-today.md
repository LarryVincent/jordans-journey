**Jordan Portrait**

I am strong.  
I am temperamental.  
I am blossoming.  
I am confident.  
I am apt to laugh.  
I am prone to indulge in sweets.  
I am transfixed by music.  
I am loving school.  
I am perplexed by my brother  
(and sometimes my mom).  
I am a princess, and a young lady, and still just a girl.  
I am funny and profound  
&ndash; very often dizzyingly so.  
I am smart.  
I am impatient.  
I am imaginative.  
I am my own self.  
I am healthy.

I am kicking cancer&rsquo;s butt.

PS: I ran this by Jordan and she said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s every bit me.&rdquo;
