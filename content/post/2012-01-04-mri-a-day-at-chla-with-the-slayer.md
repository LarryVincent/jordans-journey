Jordan went in for an MRI today. It&rsquo;s the usual process we go through every 3 months. Our nerves are prickly. We expect the worst and hope for the best. Today, we heard that not much has changed. We shouldn&rsquo;t be more worried because nothing&rsquo;s worse. And &hellip; we have very little to cheer us because there&rsquo;s no sign of progress, either.

Jordan handled it the way she always does. She got it done. She had the most positive attitude. And she displayed a dignity, grace and poise that few people twice her age could muster. I thought I&rsquo;d just show you in pictures.
