Jeanette and Jordan

She did very well today for the MRI. She went through the accessing process without any fuss, and she woke up easily (always a gamble). When I got home tonight, she was lounging comfortably and was very talkative. I didn&rsquo;t go with her today, but I received texts from Jeanette throughout the morning.

She was pretty nervous, but somehow she kept her anxiety in check. And when it was done, she seemed quite relieved. Now, we wait for the results on Wednesday.
