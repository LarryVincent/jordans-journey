One More Run  
We started our first full day of vacation in Beaver Creek today. Jordan couldn&rsquo;t wait to go out and play in the snow. Within the first 10 minutes of her frolicking she managed to make a snow angel, bean her brother with snowballs, build a &ldquo;girl fort&rdquo; and roll around in it for awhile. She&rsquo;s having a blast.

This afternoon we borrowed sleds from the front desk and tackled a small hill. Jordan went further and with more speed than any of us. I suspect a big reason is her slight frame and light weight &ndash; but she took great pride in her accomplishments. The sledding outing ended in a giant snowball war. I accidentally beaned Jordan in the face. I was convinced this would start a melt-down. She looked at me with a stunned expression for about a second, then it turned to a smile and even faster, a &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you back for that&rdquo; grimace. She did get me back. I should mention that she has a very strong throwing arm. Surprisingly good aim!  
Tomorrow she has a private lesson with a snowboard instructor. She&rsquo;s really looking forward to it, although she confessed to me this morning, &ldquo;sometimes it freaks me out.&rdquo;
