Hooded Bandits

She was supposed to clean her room, but she spent most of the day prancing around with a feather duster. I occupied my time playing with the camera. Occasionally, she would sit with me for a portrait or comment on one of the photos. She&rsquo;s excited for summer to start, and she&rsquo;s eager to go to camp. Though she doesn&rsquo;t let on, I think she was rather pleased with her latest test results. I hope she always carries this mighty strength with her, well into the days when she is old and grey &hellip; when others begin to act a little feeble. With her will and her energy, she could conquer the world.
