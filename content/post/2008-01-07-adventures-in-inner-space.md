She goes in for MRI today. She has a lot of apprehension this time around. She asked about it constantly over the weekend, and bristled occasionally when she really thought about all that goes into it. It&rsquo;s a sign that she&rsquo;s getting older. She&rsquo;s mature enough to know what&rsquo;s going on. And she&rsquo;s asked this time to see pictures from the scan. For $5, she&rsquo;ll walk away with a disk full of images of the demon that stalks her everyday. She&rsquo;s very interested to see what her cancer looks like. I&rsquo;m very curious to see how she handles it, what she grasps, how it affects her.

I didn&rsquo;t go with the girls today. Last night Jordan asked if I would hold her hand, like I usually do. I told her that Mommy would have to because I thought I would go to work. She smiled and said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold Mom&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo; Then she gave me a giant hug and started rambling on about all the things she was going to do Tuesday. We don&rsquo;t talk much about Mondays.
