Two To Watch

The girls let me photograph them this afternoon and I thought it would make a nice addition to The Journey.

The light glints off them.  
The heavens shine on them.  
The highlights intrigue them.  
The shadows define them.

They glide together,  
in turbulence and in skies of tranquil calm.  
They move and pause and dart and bank,  
and with them the world follows.  
My two, my lovelies.
