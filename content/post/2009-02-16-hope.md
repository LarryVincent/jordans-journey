Portrait in Knit Hat 3

In her confident gaze, I see all that is \_right\_ with the world. She doesn&rsquo;t blame. She rises. She doesn&rsquo;t regret. She hopes. The reason I laugh and cherish, imagine and float, is because of that spirit. It&rsquo;s uniquely hers. Even when she is dour, that life is in her. It never surrenders and it never resigns to the pessimism of others. Her spirit is living. It&rsquo;s sublime.
