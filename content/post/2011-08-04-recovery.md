She&rsquo;s awake in recovery. We&rsquo;ve been chatting. First words out of her mouth: I want to change into my pajamas.

She has to stay flat on her back for 8 hours. She&rsquo;s cooperating, but not pleased. Her blood pressure is low, so she may move to ICU before a regular room.

So far, her right leg is unresponsive. She is able to move her left and wiggle the toes on her left foot. It&rsquo;s still early.

I told her she is amazing. She said, groggily, &ldquo;why wouldn&rsquo;t I be?&rdquo;
