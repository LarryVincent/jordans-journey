Jordan, The Persistent

She plops down on the sofa next to me and sighs.  
&ndash; When are we going to the store to buy my tea?  
&ndash; When you clean your room.  
&ndash; Oh!  
She groans and heaves another sigh.  
&ndash; You always want me to clean my room.  
&ndash; If you didn&rsquo;t mess it up, we wouldn&rsquo;t ask you to clean it.  
&ndash; But I want to get that tea. I love that tea.  
&ndash; And I want you to clean your room.  
She shakes her head and flaps her hand in the air.  
&ndash; We have two problems, she says philosophically.  
Jeanette lifts her book closer to her face in order to hide the laughter.
