The first text message buzzed my phone at 6:56am. I was at the office already, rewriting a chapter for my book. The message was from Jordan and it said, &ldquo;JV.&rdquo; This is her code she sometimes sends me when she wants me to call her, but it is just as often sent when she&rsquo;s bored and wants to say hello. Because it was so early, I assumed it was the latter and sent back the word &lsquo;love,&rsquo; as I often do.

Two minutes later, another text message streamed throughâ€”this one a picture of her mother sitting in a cafe. I thought it was odd, but I played along. I took a picture of myself sitting at my desk, waving to her. &ldquo;Yep,&rdquo; I thought. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s bored.&rdquo;

Fifteen minutes later Jeanette texts me. &ldquo;Jordan&rsquo;s coming home today.&rdquo;

I will try to temper my frustration at the always spontaneous and frequently disorganized crew at Childrens Hospital so that I can do a happy dance. My daughter is coming home today. Not on a day pass. For good. After evaluating her this morning, her lead doctor has decided that she&rsquo;s strong enough to continue her therapy as an out-patient. We are thrilled to have her back. Thank you to everyone who helped us get through the last month. Jordan appreciated all of your thoughtful messages and frequent visits.
