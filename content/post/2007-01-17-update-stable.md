Jordan&rsquo;s MRI went well. She did not like getting accessed and fought the nurses more than usual, but everything otherwise went as planned. The radiologist&rsquo;s report is due tomorrow, but a preliminary scan by her doctor seems to show stable progress &ndash; no new growth (and no new reduction). She&rsquo;s a little groggy from the anesthesia. Tomorrow she begins her new chemo cycle.
