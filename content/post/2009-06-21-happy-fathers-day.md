She gave me a handsome handmade card. She drew all the pictures, and dictated her sentiments to her school aid. Here&rsquo;s what I received in the booklet card, panel by panel:  
&ndash;  
He&rsquo;s a great tickler! He knows my tickle spots, especially the one under my arm and my neck!  
&ndash;  
I also like to watch Andy Rooney with my Dad!  
&ndash;  
He&rsquo;s so clever about making podcasts with me.  
&ndash;  
And he&rsquo;s so busy working on my book.  
&ndash;  
He&rsquo;s the only one who can say fast &ldquo;snugglebug sugarbug snicklefritz.&rdquo;  
&ndash;  
He&rsquo;s a great cook! He makes the best scrambled eggs and soft bacon.  
&ndash;  
I love when he reads books to me and we cuddle.  
&ndash;  
It&rsquo;s great to have a dad like mine. He&rsquo;s the best dad ever!  
&ndash;  
I love my dad. Love, Jordan

I read this thing over and over, and every time, my eyes get wet. Love that girl.
