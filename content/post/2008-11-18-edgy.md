She heads to CHLA in about an hour for her quarterly MRI. I&rsquo;ve never seen her this anxious before. She&rsquo;s really worked herself up into a bundle of nerves. To top it off, she&rsquo;s had a nasty headache since she awoke. When you add that to the mandatory fasting before anesthesia, you have an uncomfortable, nervous, somewhat dramatic patient on your hands. But she has reason to be nervous, so we sit with her, hold her hand, share encouraging stories, and try to keep her comfortable. Send good thoughts our way today.
