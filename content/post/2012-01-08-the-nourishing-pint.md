People who know me know that I rarely refuse a good pint. This week, our family could not refuse the offer to give Jordan a pint of blood. Her counts had dipped on several fronts, so it was time to give her a boost. And boy did it ever! She has been bubbly all weekend, smiling and hanging out. She hasn&rsquo;t been napping all day like last week. Instead, she&rsquo;s chatty and alert. Meanwhile, I&rsquo;ve been teasing her that she must be part vampire. I get the same response.  
&ndash; Very funny, Dad.
