Her eyes contain an old soul with a young heart.  
She’s been here before.  
Nothing life can’t cure, she thinks.  
Live it up. Live every day. Live this life, she says.  
No matter what the day brings,  
Climb back up. Push the nonsense back!  
Own a room and breathe life in it when you exhale.  
That&rsquo;s her mantra.  
She rallies those around her to party when the lights go out.  
Her eyes may look tired now and then  
But she doesn&rsquo;t rest. Unthinkable!  
You can rest when you’re dead.
