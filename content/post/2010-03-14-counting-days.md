Jordan&rsquo;s doing very well. Pain is seldom an issue anymore. She gets itchy, but she finds solace in Benadryl. She&rsquo;s very excited about Monday, when she goes in to have the first casts removed and the walking casts put on. As usual, we&rsquo;re all blown away by how she has handled the inconvenience of immobility.  
Wednesday, she has another MRI, and our fingers are crossed that cancer is even further back in the rearview mirror.
