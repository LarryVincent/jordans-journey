I am very superstitious. Truth. I cross my fingers, knock on wood and stay quiet in winning streaks. When I&rsquo;m writing a new piece of fiction, I never discuss it with anyone for fear that the idea will be jinxed. So forgive me for prefacing this journal entry with a disclaimer: it is still early and our family is learning to take one day at a time. That said, Jordan is showing signs of improvement. She was far more animated and alert today. Up until today, there&rsquo;s been a little less sparkle in Jordan&rsquo;s smile, a shallow depth in her expression and a distance in her eyes. All of these symptoms are subtle. Only those who know her would perceive the deficit. Today, it began to dissipate.<a name="more"></a>
