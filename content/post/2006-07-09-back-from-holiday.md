The family returned Sunday from a fun and restful week in Maui. Jordan learned to hula, make a lei, and build a great sand castle. She mostly loved going in the pool with her family.

Luc shredded the waves again on a surf board, Nettie loved snorkeling out at Honoloa Bay, and I challenged myself to a 35 mile bike ride, climbing over 3,500 feet with an action advneture camp on the east side of the Island.

Jordan needed the rest. This week she&rsquo;ll restart chemotherapy. She&rsquo;s also scheduled for an MRI. Keep your fingers crossed.
