She is so tall. The casts give her a half an inch, but still. When I watched her hobble around the kitchen tonight I was kind of dumbfounded. Where is my little girl? She is a young woman in the making&ndash;so mature, so lively, so lovely. I kind of lost my breath gazing on her as she parried with her mom and willed her way around the cupboards.

We had a family dinner tonight at one of my favorite restaurants. I love these. We debate. We laugh. We argue and we disagree. And it&rsquo;s wonderful. Through it all, Jordan holds her own. In two short weeks, her casts will come off and she will be free. Every day she tries something new. Rehab will be easy for this one. And I will cheer her with eyes slightly wet.
