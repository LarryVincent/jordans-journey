Jordan did not have surgery this morning. After consulting with the neurosurgical team, we agreed to wait for more conclusive signs that the shunt was malfunctioning.

She&rsquo;s still unconscious, but resting comfortably. The good news is that her scans are stable &#8211; there&rsquo;s even signs that some of the tumor thickness is reduced. But we don&rsquo;t know why she&rsquo;s out or what triggered this latest round of symptoms.
