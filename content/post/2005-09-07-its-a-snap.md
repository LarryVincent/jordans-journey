Somehow I missed the call. I didn&rsquo;t notice until I set my phone on the desk and saw the alert flashing that I had a message. My day had been so long and tiresome I almost ignored it, but curiosity got the better of me and I dialed in to voicemail. It was Jordan.

&ldquo;Dad, I snapped! All by myself. A real snap!&rdquo;

Her voice oozed with pride. I sat back in my chair and listened to the message over and over, and I thought to myself, &ldquo;Hot damn!&rdquo;<a name="more"></a>

Henri-Frederic Amiel was a swiss philosopher and poet of the 19th century. His reputation is so obscure today that only philosophy majors tend to know his name. His one great work, _Journal Intime_, however, is filled with profound observations that often find their way into term papers and editorial columns. This one is no exception. I reference him now because he wrote something that perfectly heralds Jordan&rsquo;s small victory.

&ldquo;What we call little things are merely the causes of great things; they are the beginning, the embryo, and it is the point of departure which, generally speaking, decides the whole future of an existence.&rdquo;

For the last several days, Jordan has excelled at many &ldquo;little things&rdquo;. These victories are subtle to the casual observer but noticeable to her family &ndash; spelling words correctly, drawing recognizable pictures, snapping her fingers. We celebrate with measured praise because making too much fuss slows her down. She&rsquo;s a keen observer of what is and isn&rsquo;t said by those closest to her. An over-reaction only fortifies her fear that something isn&rsquo;t right. She doesn&rsquo;t want to be different. While she loves recognition, too much raises her guard. I know it sounds crazy, but we&rsquo;ve lived through this phase before.

Still, when she isn&rsquo;t looking, Nettie and I grin knowingly. The snapping fingers of a child might seem a silly refuge, but until you&rsquo;ve heard the delight in her voice, you cannot understand how wonderful an accomplishment it is. She managed this feat only a few hours after visiting Childrens Hospital for her weekly labs and an exam with the oncologist. Tomorrow, she begins first grade at a new school with teachers and friends she&rsquo;s never met before. And in a few days, she&rsquo;ll return to Childrens for the next dose of chemotherapy. But to her, it&rsquo;s all a snap. And nothing makes me prouder.
