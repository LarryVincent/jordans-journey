She’s not happy. She was all set to make her very first trip alone. We booked her first class on a flight to Portland to spend the holidays with her aunts and uncles. At 4:45am this morning, all systems were go. Alaska Airlines confirmed she was clear to board. We drove all the way to LAX to learn it was a no go. The flight was still scheduled, but due to weather, unaccompanied minors were not allowed.

She was devastated. We’ve spent the morning lifting her spirits and promising to rebook her flight early in the year, when the weather is better. I told her the bright side: she gets to have Santa visit her own house.
