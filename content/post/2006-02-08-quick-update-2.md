Jordan is doing well and working hard at the rehab clinic. Each day she follows a fast-paced, intensely regimented agenda of physical, occupational, and speech therapy. It&rsquo;s still too early to tell how much progress is being made, but we&rsquo;re getting a lot of good feedback from her physicians and specialists.

The toll of being away from home so much is starting to show. She&rsquo;s still generally happy and upbeat, but she gets blue now and then. She&rsquo;s also started having a few more &ndash; as we lovingly refer to them &ndash; &ldquo;hissy fits&rdquo;, but she gets over it and finds playful ways to lift her spirits.
