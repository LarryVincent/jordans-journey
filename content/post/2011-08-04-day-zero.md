We are in the waiting area for pre-op. Jordan is perky. She has already had me read her two books and she&rsquo;s now sampling video games. I think she took my advice to heart. She&rsquo;s letting Nettie and I do all the worrying. Her only complaint so far is that it is taking too long &hellip; and she hates the hospital pajamas. She heads up to pre-op in about 15 minutes.
