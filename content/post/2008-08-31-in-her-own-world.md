Absorbed

In her head it&rsquo;s pleasant. She barrels through life, absorbed in the fancies of her mind. The rest of us are spectators. There&rsquo;s a charm to it. Sometimes it makes you mad, positively batty. But then you watch her, floating in the whispers of her whims, and it&rsquo;s all you can do but sigh and chuckle and relish.
