Chalk another one up for our cancer slayer. The radiation worked! The tumor in her spine decreased from 25mm to 17mm. The doctors are very pleased. We&rsquo;re very pleased. Our circle of friends is very pleased. It&rsquo;s exactly the outcome we hoped for. Jordan took it all in stride. While we talked with Dr. Finlay and celebrated success, all Jordan cared about was getting out of the hospital so she could go to Denny&rsquo;s (a restaurant that neither Jeanette nor I care for much). 

I have a lot to share, but can&rsquo;t today. Writing a book is much harder work than I remember. When I get a break, I have to share some great stories&ndash;like the celebrity encounter she enjoyed yesterday. It was pretty special and I&rsquo;m pretty much a tease. More to come soon. Tonight, our whole family celebrates our tough hero. Onward!
