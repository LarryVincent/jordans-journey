She is draped in purple, preening herself in the company of her Auntie Lisa, who is blow drying her hair. They gossip and sample cosmetics. Jordan angles to the side and tilts her head with a healthy embelishment of feminine sass. She is having the time of her life. Her skin shines. Her cheeks blush. Her eyes charm on cue. This is why she survives. This is the life that is on her side as she kicks cancer&rsquo;s sorry butt.

On this day of Thanksgiving, Jeanette and I are most grateful for Jordan&rsquo;s health and prosperity. We give thanks that our girl continues to grow into a fascinatingly beautiful young woman. And while the disease still threatens from the fringes, we are grateful to have been blessed with a child who never gives up and never lets the struggle rob her of her childhood.

We are also grateful for our friends and our family. You have all been tremendously supportive over these six long years, and we are blessed with a constant stream of love and care. As you know, this year we asked our community of friends to join us in supporting the Pediatric Brain Tumor Foundation during the month of November. Jordan set a goal of raising $1,000. I am pleased to report that we have raised more than $1,600 for this very worthy cause. Thank you for making a difference. Thank you for all that you do.

&ndash;The Vincent Family
