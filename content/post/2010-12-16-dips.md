Her counts are low again, and she had to get another shot of GCSF. She was not pleased with the shot part. She may need a few more. She&rsquo;s been fatigued, but she still has her personality. I&rsquo;ve been on the road all week. Still, I get calls from her to ask how I&rsquo;m doing. She has the most lovely tone when she calls. When I ask how she&rsquo;s doing she&rsquo;s always nonchalant. Last night, when she realized she called me during a client dinner she said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s good to hear your voice Dad and I miss you, but call me after your dinner.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s sweet when she&rsquo;s concerned about me. Little does she know I&rsquo;d make any client wait to hear about her day.
