The news is actually better than I imagined. Jordan&rsquo;s doctors are now very confident that what we see in the MRI scans is actually scar tissue. Based on the few patients similar to Jordan who have reached this stage and had biopsies, the tissue biopsied has been benign. Because there is no evidence of new growth, the doctors believe she really has kicked the disease&rsquo;s butt. They are so confident, they want to remove her port after she has the leg surgery.

To say that we are happy is a gross understatement. We celebrated at El Cholo. Jordan beamed with pride. But true to form, when I congratulated her on her accomplishment, she said, &ldquo;yeah, and I did great when I got my flu shot.&rdquo; She appears to have won a 6-year war with cancer and what makes her proud? She didn&rsquo;t cry when she got a flu shot. God, I love my daughter!
