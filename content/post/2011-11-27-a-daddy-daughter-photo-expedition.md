Jordan and I ventured around our block at twilight. Our mission: take pictures of ordinary things and find life in them. She would take pictures seated in the wheelchair, and I&rsquo;d stand. We&rsquo;d look for the differences in our point of view. Here are the results of our photographic journey together.

Jordan&rsquo;s is on the left, mine on the right.
