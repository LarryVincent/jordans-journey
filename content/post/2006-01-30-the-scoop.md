Jordan checked in to CHLA this afternoon. She&rsquo;s full of energy and seemingly unphased by life in the rehab clinic. She kept the staff laughing in the playroom and served up plenty of sass to cause one of the attendants to remark, &ldquo;she&rsquo;s got spunk.&rdquo;

Tomorrow she&rsquo;ll begin a rigorous schedule. From 8:30am to noon she&rsquo;s booked solid with physical and occupational therapy. She gets a break from noon to 1:30, then it&rsquo;s back to work until 3:30. She&rsquo;ll have school lessons sprinkled in for good measure.

If you&rsquo;re planning to visit her, evenings are best. Send me an email or call me to ensure she&rsquo;ll be around when you plan to stop by. She loves having visitors. Her grandparents stopped by tonight and she thought it was very cool.
