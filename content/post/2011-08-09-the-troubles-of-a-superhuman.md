I suspect that Superman feels this way after he&rsquo;s expunged the kryptonite only to find Lex Luther has hatched another diabolical plan. In his head, he must think, &ldquo;good grief!&rdquo; Perhaps every superhero has a Charlie Brown alter ego. That&rsquo;s how Jordan must feel. It&rsquo;s not enough to slay cancer. You have to relearn how to use your legs. And you can&rsquo;t go home!

Â 

She&rsquo;s super human. In every way. In five days she&rsquo;s proven that she can take a superhuman punch and get right back up on her feet &hellip; almost. We&rsquo;re grateful the legs are working, but they&rsquo;ve got a ways to go before she can chasse around the house and keep us on our toes. Make no mistake, she&rsquo;s on them as often as she can. The only complaint you hear when it&rsquo;s time for physical therapy is how much she&rsquo;s sweating.

This is why I am intoxicated with this girl.

Yet, make no mistake, she gets blue.

It&rsquo;s the pace that troubles her. She wants to be home. She wants to be on her feet. She wants it all to be over. Who can blame her? I think that&rsquo;s the curse of being superhuman. Everyone admires you and everyone applauds your derring-does. But you just want to do like the rest of the world. I suspect that sometimes superheroes like Jordan want to be perfectly ordinary. They mumble to themselves, &ldquo;yeah, yeah, yeah &hellip; give me a pair of pajamas and the remote to the television.&rdquo; Of course, they can&rsquo;t have it. There&rsquo;s another challenge to face. Sisyphus has it easy, they think. Give him my boulder and then cry me a river.

We read together tonight. I did my best acting job and she sat quietly, listening &hellip; tapping her fingers across the side of the hospital bed, smiling at me when I looked up from the page. Every so often I&rsquo;d ask if she was alright and she&rsquo;d say, &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; Then I&rsquo;d read some more.

Nurses came in occasionally to check on this or that. One said, &ldquo;I want to pull up a chair.&rdquo; Jordan smiled and said, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s my Daddy.&rdquo; I felt superhuman, and yet totally helpless. I suspect that&rsquo;s how she feels times ten. But it doesn&rsquo;t stop her.

Tomorrow she begins in-patient physical therapy. She&rsquo;ll put her body to the test on an aggressive regimen geared towards making her legs obey her will. That&rsquo;s a tall order, but she&rsquo;s given it before. No one doubts what she&#8217;lll accomplish. Not her doctors or her parents or even her. Still, that&rsquo;s small consolation for a girl who wants to do what all the other girls do. It must be lonely. As much as I&rsquo;m grateful she&rsquo;s superhuman, my greatest wish is that she can be super as an ordinary human.
