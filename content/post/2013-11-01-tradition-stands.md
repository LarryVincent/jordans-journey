We have an annual Halloween tradition. I asked Jeanette when it started. She was unsure. We think it began the year that Jordan broke the curse–the annual misfortune that struck us in the month of October. In 2004, Jordan was diagnosed. In 2005, she ended up in a wheelchair. In 2006, she was in a coma. But in 2007, we got through the month without any trips to hospitals or setbacks in health. To celebrate that year, only on October 31st, we ordered El Cholo, our favorite Mexican restaurant and an LA tradition. Ever since, we eat El Cholo on Halloween. This year was no different.<!-- more -->

Of course, the story is not that easy. I got a text from Jeanette around 4pm that Jordan had a seizure while out trick-or-treating. It was a big one and the girls were alone about a mile from home. Jeanette sat with Jordan on the street as she wandered in the neuro fields. When she came to, she got up and walked half a mile uphill (I’m not making this up) to the bus stop.

While Jordan usually wants to sleep after a big seizure, she would not negate tradition today. I met the ladies at the restaurant. We toasted the end of the green corn tamales season with rich, delicious food. And The Slayer enjoyed every last bit.

To tradition!
