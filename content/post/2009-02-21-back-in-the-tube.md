Jordan&rsquo;s Saturday iPod Maneuver

It&rsquo;s back to the MRI this week. On Wednesday. The mood is mellower than usual. It&rsquo;s not to say we worry less. We just cope better. Jordan went in for a &ldquo;walk study&rdquo; on Friday. They punctured electrodes into her muscles and asked her to walk on a treadmill for a bit. They want to see if she can avoid surgery on her legs. The jury is out. But at least we have more data. Data is good. We&rsquo;ll have a dose more on the progress in her head on Wednesday. Think good thoughts.
