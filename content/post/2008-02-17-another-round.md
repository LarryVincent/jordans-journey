Jordan Holds Court at Dinner

She is doing brilliantly well. Though I haven&rsquo;t posted for some time, rest assured. She is buoyant, industrious and sometimes charming. We&rsquo;ve been celebrating her new-found dedication to school. Over the last few weeks, she&rsquo;s attended nearly every day and made it through day far more often than usual. She&rsquo;s proud of this accomplishment.
