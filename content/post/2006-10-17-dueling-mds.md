An update: neurosurgery attempted to &ldquo;tap&rdquo; Jordan&rsquo;s shunt today, in order to rule out a blockage. To tap it means to try and draw spinal fluid from a needle inserted into a well at the base of the shunt in her head (it sounds more painful than it is). The neurosurgeon was unable to draw any fluid, so the new theory is that her shunt is malfunctioning and requires a &ldquo;revision&rdquo; &ndash; surgery to repair or replace it.

We&rsquo;re pushing back on the docs to ensure that this is a consensus opinion. If it is, Jordan will undergo surgery tomorrow morning. I will post more when I have more information.
