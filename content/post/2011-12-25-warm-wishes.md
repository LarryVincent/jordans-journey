At this holiday time of year, our whole family is grateful for all the love and support we receive. I&rsquo;m often asked how it is that we&rsquo;re so strong. My first response is to say that we draw all our strength from &ldquo;the girl.&rdquo; The truth is more complicated. Jordan guides us and gives us the energy to be optimistic and brave. But we don&rsquo;t travel on this journey alone, and we would be lost without the constant kindness of people we&rsquo;ve known forever and strangers we&rsquo;ve only just met.

Holidays are a strange time for our family. No one knows how to behave anymore. We have fragile expectations. We roll through the festivities as easily as we can. This year has been a little harder than others. Neither Jeanette nor I have had much of the holiday spirit. There&rsquo;s no particular reason. We just don&rsquo;t feel it. Jordan&rsquo;s new clinical trial doesn&rsquo;t help. She&rsquo;s doing fine, but she sleeps constantly. She is awake for only a few hours every day, and then she&rsquo;s kind of out of it. It&rsquo;s gotten worse since the doctors added new medication to try and bring her tremors under control. The new meds are essentially muscle relaxers. She&rsquo;s very relaxed, but rarely alert. Since many of Jordan&rsquo;s muscles are still recovering from surgery, the muscle relaxers are creating other problems. She falls a lot because her legs are weaker. And she has &ldquo;accidents&rdquo; in the middle of the night that disrupt her sleep and hurt her self-confidence.

Still, when she&rsquo;s awake she&rsquo;s loving and as optimistic as she always is. She had a very nice Christmas. And she&rsquo;s looking forward to the new year. We all are.

She was very excited to receive a new handbag for Christmas.

She&rsquo;s taken to napping on the sofa. Her favorite way is to wrap herself up in a blanket and curl up in a ball with just her hair peeking out.
