She&rsquo;s had a very good morning. She slept well. She woke up smiling. She had no trouble standing on her own. She asked to go play. She ate a full breakfast and asked me to bring her tea this afternoon. We laughed as we pinched mommy and we joked about how clumsy I am. The neurosurgeons paid a visit early in the morning, and we were very glad to see Dr. McComb back on rounds. Something about his presence puts us at ease. She&rsquo;s still in PICU, but only because they cannot find a bed for her elsewhere in the hospital. They want to move her today. All of the tubes are gone, except for a dangling IV that they connect only when they need to administer medications. <a name="more"></a>

We&rsquo;ve been told that Dr. Finlay, the lead oncologist, will stop by to meet with us once she&rsquo;s moved out of the PICU. We&rsquo;re hoping that the pathology report has arrived so that we know more about what we&rsquo;re dealing with. The delivery of that report is the biggest point of contradiction. Some assert that it will definitely arrive today, others claim it takes far more time. We&rsquo;re not sure what to expect.

In preparation for the pathology report, I started making contact with other pediatric oncologists across the country. I have a disc with Jordan&rsquo;s MRI scans on it, and I have requested a hard copy of the pathology report. These I plan to overnight to any expert who will review the case. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t trust Dr. Finlay, because he&rsquo;s come with very high praise. I want to ensure we&rsquo;ve evaluated all of the treatment options before we proceed. Many of you have contacted me with connections to various doctors. Thank you for all of your suggestions. I have sent replies to some of you. I am most interested in finding inroads to UCLA because their pediatric oncology unit is very highly regarded. Other hospitals of interest: Children&rsquo;s National Medical Center, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Boston, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Philadelphia, City of Hope, Johns Hopkins Hospital. If you have any connections at any of these hospitals, please send me an email with directions on how I can connect.
