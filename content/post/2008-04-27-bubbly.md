Jordan, age 9 &frac12; in April

She&rsquo;s very excited today because she&rsquo;s been invited to interview with a video crew doing a piece for the Lance Armstrong Foundation. This morning she asked her mom about it. She wanted to know what questions she might be asked. Jeanette helped her recall her experiences.  
Sometimes, Jordan&rsquo;s memory is fuzzy. For instance, when we asked her about her first symptoms, she recalls losing power in her legs. We reminded her that she was symptomatic much earlier than that. We asker her if she remembered when she got the headaches so bad, or when she had trouble remembering things at school.  
She squinted her eyes and thought for a minute, then shook her head.  
It&rsquo;s okay, we told her. &ldquo;We can remember that part for you.&rdquo;
