LMV 35 (1)

There is a quiet process that occupies her mind. It foments an insurrection. No matter how the forces &lsquo;gainst it push, it bends and strengthens in the heat of misfortune and capitalizes on spirited emotion. That tiny instinct, a cancer of its own design, invades everything she does. You can thrash her down with bad news, but it will rise up and push her to find a light. It never dims. It flickers at times, but it never fades.

The recent news hit Jordan hard, but it hasn&rsquo;t quieted her resolve. She missed school today. She stayed in bed, sleeping off a bad headache. She hated the morning and got off to a slow start. But by the time I returned home, she was perky. She cheered the Lakers and looked forward to a chapter from a book. The hug she gave me made me stop my pathetic moping. She made me feel almost as strong as she when she grabbed my hand and said, &ldquo;you are so warm. I missed you, Dad.&rdquo;

It doesn&rsquo;t matter what is done by the other insurgent force that occupies her head. Her will is stronger. And for the moment, she has decided she&rsquo;d rather be herself. I love that. I wish I could summon it as easily.
