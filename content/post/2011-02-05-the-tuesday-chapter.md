Jordan begins radiation therapy this Tuesday. She was fitted on Friday and proud of herself because she didn&rsquo;t need sedation (some patients find it difficult to control the gag reflex when the mold is created for the mouth-guard). She called me to tell me that she received a new blanket from the CHLA team (her third).

&ndash;Sweetheart, I&rsquo;m glad it went well &hellip; but you already have two blankets.  
&ndash;Well, they told me I could have another one.  
&ndash;Is it nice?  
&ndash;It&rsquo;s so cool. I can&rsquo;t wait for you to see it.

Because the tumor is in a sensitive part of the spine, she will receive a small dose of radiation about every day for six weeks. She _will_ have to be sedated for each session because healthy tissue could be damaged if she moves the slightest bit. Fortunately, each dose lasts for only 2 minutes, so she won&rsquo;t be out for long.

Jeanette and I are cautiously optimistic about the new chapter on Jordan&rsquo;s Journey. We keep telling ourselves it&rsquo;s going to work. On the other hand, we worry about the consequences if it doesn&rsquo;t. Jordan can only receive six weeks of radiation therapy. After that, any additional radiation to the spine could be dangerous. That means, if it doesn&rsquo;t work, we&rsquo;ll have to revisit the subject of surgery or perhaps some very aggressive chemotherapy drugs. Right now, we&rsquo;re trying to stay positive and we&rsquo;re hoping for good news in six weeks.

Some of you have asked why I haven&rsquo;t posted much. I am at work on a big writing project and haven&rsquo;t had much time to update you all. Rest assured that Miss J is her usual self and I&rsquo;ve kept my notebook handy to jot down some of her unique moments to share with you soon.
