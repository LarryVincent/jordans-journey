  My sister Lisa and Ricky, her fiance, surprised Jordan with a visit this weekend, en route to Europe. Jordan acted coy about it all at first, but within 15 minutes she was parading around with the Aunt who refers to her as &ldquo;mini me.&rdquo; There is an awful lot of similarities between the two. It was a good way to end the weekend.

Jordan is doing well. The new chemo drugs seem to make her more nauseous, but she won&rsquo;t be doing them as often. She gets a break from the IV this week.
