As we walked the corridors of CHLA, we were greeted by a couple of nurses and technicians. Jeanette and I said hello and stepped into the elevator on our way to the cafeteria while Jordan underwent an MRI.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s really sad that we recognize all these people,&rdquo; I said.

&ldquo;No. It&rsquo;s sad that they recognize us,&rdquo; Jeanette replied.<a name="more"></a>

She is right. We are back at CHLA and it&rsquo;s all become too familiar. What&rsquo;s different is the lack of instigating circumstances. No falls. No surgeries. No significant changes in Jordan&rsquo;s pathology. But she&rsquo;s out. There has been no progress in her condition. She&rsquo;s still unconcscious, only occasionally opening her eyes. When she does so her eyes are fully dilated, feral and bereft. It&rsquo;s as if she isn&rsquo;t really there. She sleeps until a wild impulse overtakes her, so wild that the nurses have taped pillows to the sides of the bed. They keep a close watch on her. Last night she stood up in the middle of the night and tried to walk across the room. She wasn&rsquo;t awake.

We are on a quest for answers. They are in short supply. Thus far the tests are inconclusive. The tumor appears stable. Her vitals normal. All we have now is a theory: Jordan may be having strokes.

Do you remember the scene from Jaws where Roy Scheider first realizes what&rsquo;s going on when the shark attacks on Independence Day? Steven Spielberg used a cinematic technique pioneered by Hitchcock, called a reverse tracking shot. The camera dollies away very quickly while the camera operator zooms in with the lens. It creates an effect where the depth of field changes rapidly creating a feeling of isolated dizziness. That&rsquo;s how we felt today when we first heard the word &ldquo;stroke.&rdquo;

Jeanette asked the obvious question. Is it common for a child to have a stroke? The doctor&rsquo;s answer held little comfort: no, but it&rsquo;s also not common for a child to have this much disease in the brain.

&ldquo;This much disease in the brain.&rdquo; We heard this phrase before, by another doctor. Those words strung together about your child are like someone punching you hard in the belly. You can&rsquo;t breathe for a minute. You don&rsquo;t know how to respond. You know it&rsquo;s true. It&rsquo;s not new information. But it stuns nonetheless, kind of like the words &ldquo;malignant brain tumor&rdquo; and &ldquo;cancer.&rdquo; Add &ldquo;stroke&rdquo; to the list.

And it makes sense: the partial paralysis on one side of the body, memory loss, agitation, drooping of the face, loss of consciousness. How could we not have considered this before? Maybe because she&rsquo;s eight.

Jeanette and I don&rsquo;t know how to feel. My mind has been racing since yesterday morning when I first learned Jordan had relapsed. I am restless and confused and uncertain about where to let my mind wander. Jeanette describes a similar emotional state. Cancer has a certain gravity that can be assuaged by countless success stories. Even though Jordan&rsquo;s cancer is rare, we took comfort in its pace and lack of aggression. A stroke is a different matter, made ominous by the lack of treatment options.

That said, we don&rsquo;t know for sure that Jordan is having strokes. It is a theory &ndash; a theory that sadly makes sense, but is unproven. In a couple of days the doctors will order another CT scan. They will compare the results to the scan from yesterday. Ordinarily, evidence of a stroke can be seen on the film after a couple of days. Until then, we wait. We sing to her. We rest a hand on her back and brush the hair from her face. We talk about other subjects and manage the things that can&rsquo;t be ignored. And we wait.
