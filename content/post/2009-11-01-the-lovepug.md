The Lovepug

Fewer words on the blog always means the same thing: progress. I must admit, I&rsquo;m a little reticent to say much every tenth month of the year. It&rsquo;s one of my favorite months, but for so many years it was a curse for Jordan. She beat that curse in 2007, and ever since we&rsquo;ve been so happy not to spend time in hospitals or wringing our hands hoping she was okay. She is more than okay. She is fabulous.  
She has taken a break from chemotherapy for the past two months and you&rsquo;d almost wonder if she&rsquo;d ever been sick at all. Sure, her logic is dizzy at times, but she&rsquo;s quick as a wit in her observations and her stream of conversation. We still worry about the legs. We need to fix those, but quite honestly, we&rsquo;ve been loving this &ldquo;normal period.&rdquo; We&rsquo;re loving time as a family, without needles or protocols.  
So, another October passes and Jordan focuses on how much candy she can bag, rather than how many days until she can go home. That&rsquo;s progress. That&rsquo;s my daughter.
