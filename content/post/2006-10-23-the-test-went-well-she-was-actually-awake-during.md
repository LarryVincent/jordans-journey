The test went well. She was actually awake during most of it and she was very cooperative. It took a long time. We have no new information, other than the pressure was not elevated. That pretty much rules out a shunt malfunction.

She&rsquo;s much more talkative. She keeps saying she wants to go home. I think she keeps asking so that one time we&rsquo;ll slip and say, &ldquo;okay.&rdquo; She doesn&rsquo;t look sad as much as she looks cross and determined. We love it. Her fighting spirit is in full force. If she keeps up at this pace, she may get her wish very soon. But there are still mountains to climb. She&rsquo;s eating through a tube, speaking sloppily, and barely able to use her right arm. We just keep encouraging her to &ldquo;get mad at it&rdquo; and &ldquo;show her tough stuff.&rdquo; She will.
