The Slayer is lounging with me in our living room. KCRW is blasting on the system. We&rsquo;re happy and we&rsquo;re chilling on a drizzly Saturday night. She&rsquo;s hard at work on a list. She makes lists all the time. Lists of things she wants. Lists of things she admires. Lists of letters she doesn&rsquo;t quite understand but finds interesting. Little does she know she&rsquo;s a closet typographer.

At one point, she gets completely frustrated with the capital D she is trying to sketch. She crumples up her paper in disgust. I counsel her. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong, honey?&rdquo;

&ndash;I can&rsquo;t draw a D at all!

&ndash;Yes, you can.

&ndash;You&rsquo;re just saying that to make me feel better.

I wasn&rsquo;t. I saw her D. It was just fine. But I was actually glad to hear her say those words. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just saying that to make me feel better.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s a dose of self-awareness I haven&rsquo;t heard from her much. I worry sometimes that she&rsquo;s un-attuned to the nuances of speech. Another kid makes a sarcastic comment and she doesn&rsquo;t get it. The protective me wishes she got it so she could say, &ldquo;buzz off!&rdquo; She rarely does. But tonight, she was back in my face and I couldn&rsquo;t have been more pleased. The truth was that I wasn&rsquo;t placating her at all. She drew a good D. But that comment was my cue to work with her.

She drew a series of capital D&rsquo;s. We discussed how to make their curves symmetrical and I taught her how to sketch before hardening her lines. She worked and worked and the next thing I knew she had drawn a perfectly formed D. We high-fived. She was proud. And so was I. 

I love it when she does this&ndash;when she perseveres. She&rsquo;s the strongest soul I&rsquo;ve ever met.
