It was a good week for the girl. She was extremely anxious about starting radiation, but after her first treatment she realized it wasn&rsquo;t so hard and it took less time than chemo. She&rsquo;s holding up well. She asked me to take her to her photography class today. It was great to watch her play with photos. She has a genuine interest in the subject and she&rsquo;s taking some beautiful shots. I&rsquo;ll post some soon.

She&rsquo;s still not so sure about the purple ink on her face, but she seems less self-conscious. She doesn&rsquo;t wear a hat anymore and she isn&rsquo;t very shy about mixing up with strangers. We have scheduled a fantastic photo shoot for next weekend, and she&rsquo;s pretty excited. She&rsquo;s also excited because this Tuesday she will probably appear in an episode of Glee. She was one of about eight patients who were invited to shoot a sequence with Jane Lynch and Matthew Morrison a few weeks ago. She had a GREAT time on the set at Paramount Studios and she&rsquo;s pretty pumped up about the possibility that she&rsquo;ll see herself on television this week. It doesn&rsquo;t hurt that she also is a big Gleek.
