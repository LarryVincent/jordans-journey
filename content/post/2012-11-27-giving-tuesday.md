Today is Giving Tuesday, and I&rsquo;d like to make a plug for the Pablove Shutterbugs program. I started playing with my first camera when I was 12 years old. It was a transformational experience. That&rsquo;s why I am particularly fond of Shutterbugs, a nonprofit program that helps children living with cancer develop their own creative voice through the art of photography. Shutterbugs offers an 8-week intensive program in which children receive a camera, pair with a photographic mentor, and embark on a series of assignments that culminates in a public gallery show. It also hosts half-day workshops and support programs throughout the year.

I&rsquo;ve seen the power of the program with my own eyes. As many of you know, our Slayer was one of the first participants in the Shutterbugs program. It changed her life. She went from being a kid with cancer to a kid with a camera. I know you are hit up throughout the year with many requests to support worthwhile causes, but please consider making a contribution to this great organization. Even a small gift of $10 can make a difference in another kid&rsquo;s life by helping the Pablove Foundation purchase equipment and supplies that enables a generation of creative survivors find ways to express themselves through the lens.

There are two ways you can help. You can make a donation by visiting our fundraising page <a href="https://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> {<a href="https://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://stayclassy.org/jordanvincent</a> }. If you don&rsquo;t wish to give at this time, please consider spreading the word about the program by mentioning it on Facebook or Twitter &hellip; or forward this email on to someone else. You can learn more about the program <a href="https://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a> {<a href="https://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.pablove.org/shutterbugs/</a> }.

In celebration of the power of photography, I&rsquo;ll be sharing some photographic memories (like the one above) from Jordan&rsquo;s Journey over the next few weeks.
