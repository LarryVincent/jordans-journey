They show signs of the journey she has taken. They were once the most perfect little feet you&rsquo;ve ever seen. She ran, danced, jumped and tippy toed. She can&rsquo;t do those things now, but still I love these feet. They are the feet of a cancer slayer. They give new meaning to the word footprint.
