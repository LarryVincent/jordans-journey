She shows her many scars to her grandchildren  
and they whisper and elbow one another with rapt interest.  
She meets her brother for dinner  
and they spit and spend and speak of family memories.  
She takes her mother out for a day of shopping and a lunch with bubbles  
and they share moment after moment that can&rsquo;t be captured well.  
She looks down on little blessings that found her most unexpectedly  
and they see only a mother who is loving and warm and wonderfully free.  
She buries me with fond memories  
and the same iron will that made me love every single day with her wishes on.
