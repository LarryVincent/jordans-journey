  In our family, we speak of B.C. and A.D. Â B.C. = Before cancer. A.D. = After Diagnosis. This photo is B.C., but only slightly. Jeanette took this photo the afternoon before Jordan went in for a biopsy &ndash; on Thursday, October 7th, 2004. It was the day before we learned that Jordan had cancer. We half-suspected this was the case, which is why Jeanette took Jordan out to play. In my writing these past few weeks I&rsquo;ve been tracing history. This photo is an important memento for our family. It&rsquo;s not an end. It&rsquo;s a beginning.
