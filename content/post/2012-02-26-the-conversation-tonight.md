Jeanette: Jordan, your dinner is ready  
Jordan: (inspecting the pasta in her dish) Why did you disobey me?  
Jeanette: What?  
Jordan: Why did you disobey me?  
Jeanette: I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about, but that&#8217;s not how you talk to me.  
Jordan: I told you what I wanted for dinner. This isn&#8217;t it.  
Jeanette: Change your tone. (exits)  
I walk downstairs, hungry.  
Me: Jordan, would you like me to make you a sausage patty.  
Jordan: (cheerfully) Sure, Dad.  
(I then make said chicken sausage patty with a bit of apple sauce and seasonings. I bring to Jordan).  
Jordan: Thanks, Dad. This is so good. You know exactly what I like to eat, don&#8217;t you, Dad?  
(Jeanette taps foot in the corner)  
Moral of the story &#8212; Daddy rocks.
