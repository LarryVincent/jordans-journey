_One of many self-portraits Jordan sends me now and again._

Every once in awhile, Jordan sends me text messages from her phone. As she cannot read, she often sends me words she comes across. I&rsquo;ve had texts that read simply, &ldquo;Oreos,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Barbie.&rdquo; Sometimes she just sends me her initials or she sends me the word &ldquo;love.&rdquo; I love them all. But my favorite texts are the pictures she sends via MMS. These are usually self portraits she snapped just then with her phone. Occasionally I get a photo from her library. Today, she sent me a picture of her at about the age of two. She&rsquo;s sitting at our old dining room table, enjoying a small cup of tea. The smile on her face says it all.
