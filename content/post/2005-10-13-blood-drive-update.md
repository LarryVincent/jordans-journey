Update &ndash; Jordan did not need a transfusion today, but she will probably need one next week. I am contributing a pint today, which will be ready for her use when she goes in next for labs. Many of you responded to my last email. Thank you. We are putting a schedule together for blood banking. It&rsquo;s a perishable substance and you can only give once every 55 days. Since it is unlikely she will need blood every week, we&rsquo;re going to put a grid together and if we find ourselves short, we&rsquo;ll let you know. Thanks again for your offers and your well wishes.
