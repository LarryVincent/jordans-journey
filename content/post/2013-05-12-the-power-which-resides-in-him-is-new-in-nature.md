The Slayer has been active. She&rsquo;s had some rough days. The seizures still get in the way a lot. But she doesn&rsquo;t let them stop her. She brought home a dazzling report card this week. And she&rsquo;s taken to do more things for herself. For example, she asks to do her own laundry and seems to enjoy it (albeit on her terms). I&rsquo;ve noticed that she delights in her own independence, and Jeanette and I do all that we can to let her do more for herself. She does not fear to try, which makes me a very proud papa.
