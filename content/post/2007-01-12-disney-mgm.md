It was a slower paced day, but no less fun. We spent the majority of it at Disney/MGM. Jordan proved to be the venerable thrill-seeker we&rsquo;ve come to know and love. She rode Tower of Terror with us, and even made a funny pose for the image capture system. The highlight of her day was seeing Ariel in the Little Mermaid stage show. She&rsquo;s looking forward to tomorrow &ndash; when she has breakfast with the princesses at Epcot.
