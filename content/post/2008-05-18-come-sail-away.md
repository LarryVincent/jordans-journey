We ride together in my Jeep. She sits shotgun. The stereo blasts 70&rsquo;s classics, most of which we ignore as ambient background. She chatters incessantly; something about a trip to the mall, then on to a peacock named Barney.

The music changes and we hear the first tinkling chords of Dennis DeYoung&rsquo;s piano on Styx&rsquo;s &ldquo;Come Sail Away.&rdquo; Jordan cocks her head and ponders the descant for a moment. She tells me how much she likes the piano playing. I adjust the volume, partly to reconnect with my youth and (honestly) partly to drown out her monologue. It is to no avail. When DeYoung&rsquo;s vocal begins, she speaks loud enough to compete with the music.<a name="more"></a>

&ldquo;What a beautiful voice.&rdquo;

&ldquo;Yeah.&rdquo;

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s perfect. It could be a boy or a girl.&rdquo;

&ldquo;No, honey. It&rsquo;s a boy.&rdquo;

&ldquo;But it could be a girl.&rdquo;

The music twists and edges toward rock. Jordan begins tapping her feet on the floorboard.

&ldquo;I like this beat.&rdquo;

It is a beautiful Southern California day, and the sun beams through the sunroof. The tempo of the music and the tapping of her feet strike me and I start singing along. Jordan plays air guitar. And then, finally, the refrain. Together, the two of us battle the speakers, rolling our way up the foothills to our home.

&ldquo;Come sail away. Come sail away. Come sail away with me.&rdquo;

We continue on this way, singing together, rocking out. It feels good. I feel alive and she is smiling. When it is done, we nod to one another and give a light high five.

&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun to sing with your family,&rdquo; she says.

I agree and we back into the drive. She grabs me around the waist as we enter the house, and I cradle her head, stroking her soft hair. She thanks me. I don&rsquo;t ask why. Tomorrow she goes back for chemo to continue her fight against the disease. We are all emboldened by her recent success&ndash;grateful to be able to turn our attention to car-ride song and indulgence in classic rock.
