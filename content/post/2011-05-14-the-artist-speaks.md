     What a night! Jordan attended the <a href="http://pablove.org/galleryshow2011/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pablove Shutterbugs Graduation Show</a> this evening. Two of her photographs were included in the featured collection. They were also available for sale, and she was very proud that her prints sold out quickly.

Everything about the evening was perfect. The kids walked down a red carpet and had their pictures taken in Hollywood style as they arrived. A DJ spun great tunes as survivors and celebrities mingled around the Kopeikin Gallery, admiring the work of inspired Shutterbugs. Jordan gave an interview and proudly shared insights on her photos. It was a sublime experience that was fun, emotional, and inspiring. Our family is so grateful to all the good folks at Pablove: Jo Ann Thrailkill and Jeff Castelaz, Shutterbugs founder Cath Berclaz, and Jordan’s terrific teacher, Kate. Good souls who made a great cause possible. Please join us in supporting this program. Jordan was part of the inaugural class, but she hopes (as do we) that many more cancer slayers have the opportunity to discover their creative voice through the power of photography
