It’s been a long week. I don’t even know where to start. Jordan is still at CHLA and doing pretty well. When I have more time, I want to share some great highlights from the week. There’s so much to share – like how she met a friend on the floor who has the same birthday, and they got along so well that they decided to share a room. Or, how she calls me at least once every day just to see how my day is going. Or, how she impresses the nurses when she presses on with physical therapy even after she’s had a nasty seizure.  As you might expect, she continues to be slayer-strong, and she wins everyone over with her sassy but delightful attitude. Her legs really are getting stronger, but she’s still 3-5 weeks away from coming home.

What I really want to share today is, well, today. On day #24 she was granted a “day pass.” That means she was allowed (actually, strongly encouraged!) to leave the hospital with her family for 12 hours. It was the first time she set foot outside since surgery. We dolled her up and took her to see Harry Potter. Our whole family loves these movies and we weren’t able to go when it first came out because of the surgery. Jordan loved it! We all did. And afterward we had lunch at The Grove with our friend Catherine Davie. Jordan just beamed and we all had a great time together. I think she had so much fun that she didn’t mind so much when the afternoon was ended and it was time to go back to her rigorous schedule of recovery. I could tell you more, but I’m exhausted and I’ll let the pictures speak for themselves. I even have a little video I caught with Jordan yesterday.

While we were shopping, Jordan found a hat that she loved and I was only to happy to buy it for her. Doesn’t she look like a summer princess?

Jordan enjoyed using her new camera. She took this photo of Luc and I during our lunch at The Farm

We would have taken more photos at The Grove, but frankly, we were having too much fun. When we got back to CHLA, Jordan and I decided to chase Luc with the wheelchair. Jordan took this photo of him running from our menacing dash.

Can you tell how tuckered out this girl in curly locks was at the end of her great day? She had so much fun.

When she got back, dinner was waiting for her … and so was her Auntie Kelly. What a great way to finish the day.

My other girl, Jeanette, looks on as Jordan shares stories from her day pass day.

Luc liked playing with Jordan’s new camera. Before we left the hospital, he took this picture just for his sister. He said, “it’s a message for you, Jordan.” She thought this was cool.
