This is one of my favorite poems, and it captures how I feel about Jordan quite well. I&rsquo;m not sure where I stand on religion these days. I&rsquo;m a terrible Catholic. But this poem, by ee cummings, expresses so much of how I feel about my daughter.

Somewhere I Have Never Traveled &#8211; W[Viva], XXIX

somewhere i have never travelled,gladly beyond  
any experience,your eyes have their silence:  
in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,  
or which i cannot touch because they are too near

your slightest look easily will unclose me  
though i have closed myself as fingers,  
you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens  
(touching skillfully,mysteriously)her first rose

or if your wish be to close me,i and  
my life will shut very beautifully,suddenly,  
as when the heart of this flower imagines  
the snow carefully everywhere descending;

nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals  
the power of your intense fragility:whose texture  
compels me with the colour of its countries,  
rendering death and forever with each breathing

(i do not know what it is about you that closes  
and opens; only something in me understands  
the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)  
nobody,not even the rain,has such small hands
